## Our Three Pillars

1. Aggregating Data & Engineering insights
2. Making Political Information Accessible in meaningful interfaces
3. Engineering Open Source Software for common good

## Our Philosophy

You should know what's happening in the world.

Political Data is your data.

21st century citizens need 21st century tools.


## Software, Open Source & AI

Open Source software has a marvelous revival and many goods result of it.
AIs have recently gained the ability to understand and generate human language.

Natural Language Interfacing, where the very same language we speak enables us to interact with computes and data in ways that were unimaginable before.

This project tries to make the best of a mix of research, software development, and engineering to expand the toolset currenlty available.
This world is almost not understandable today without a look at the data. And while data analysis has been around. I have yet to see the imapct of such tools in our everyday lives. I would go so far as to say that the only graphics you see are the ones in news magazines sometimes.


## Research

Most of our focus is right now on the validity and utiltiy of LLMs in text-as-data analysis for computational social sciences.
We don't come from an engineering backgroud but rather form a political science one.
This project aims to bundle ressources, brainpower, research and tools to engineer responsible and informative tools of the next generation.
