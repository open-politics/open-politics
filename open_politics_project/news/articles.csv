https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68126892,"Liverpool singer Jamie Webster is a superstar in his home city, with a 40,000-capacity headline show coming up this summer. But his outspoken political and footballing allegiances have proved divisive elsewhere. When Webster played the biggest gigs of his career so far - two sold-out shows for 24,000 people on Liverpool's waterfront last summer - one intrepid fan spotted an opportunity to sneak in. The open-air concerts took place between two of the city's historic docks. ""There was a canal running right down the middle,"" the singer explains. ""Someone actually swam in. He didn't have a ticket, and he swam. It came through on the radio as I was in the security office. ""I said to the security, 'Look, whoever it is, please make sure you don't kick them out.' ""But the poor sod spent all his time in the medical tent."" People will apparently go to great lengths to see Webster, who has become a Scouse hero in the past few years. The former electrician made his name when 50,000 Liverpool FC fans joined him in singing his hymn to the Reds, Allez Allez Allez, before the 2019 Champions League final. Branching out from football and from his home city, Webster's anthemic and impassioned indie folk took his debut album We Get By to number six in the UK chart in 2020, and the follow-up Moments reached number three in 2022. He is hoping his third album 10 For The People, out on Friday, will give him his first number one. The 29-year-old fits catchy choruses into socially-conscious, politically-charged and observational songs about ordinary people, placing him somewhere between the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner and Billy Bragg. ""This is why the album's called 10 For The People,"" Webster says. ""It's an ode to my fans. It's an ode to the real people of the world because I haven't got here through industry backing, I haven't got here through radio playlists, I haven't got here through a major label. I haven't got here through any of that. ""It's all been done organically from grassroots, with a backdoor from a football terrace, which is unheard of. But you've got to ride your luck when you get it."" One song, Lovers in the Supermarket, was inspired by a photo his fiancee sent him of an elderly couple both holding a basket in Tesco. ""We've got a shared love of old couples,"" Webster says. ""You know when you see a really old couple walking down the street? It's beautiful, isn't it? Especially when they're of a certain age."" Webster is clearly too much of a romantic to contemplate that the basket just might have been too heavy for one of the couple to hold on their own. Upon seeing the picture, he ""almost melted"" and immediately bashed out the song. ""There are parts in the vocal where my voice goes really thin. That's because I'm welling up. For me, that's what music is - it's imagery, it's escapism, and you can realise how beautiful life is just from listening to a bit of music. ""That's what my music is. I've always said that since the first album. I document the joys, the trials and tribulations and the escapes of working-class life."" In a review of one of his concerts last summer, the Liverpool Echo said Webster ""commanded the adoring crowd who hung by his every word"". ""Music, politics and life are intrinsically linked for Jamie,"" the newspaper said, ""going seamlessly from the fast-paced Going Out to a powerful monologue before Davey Kane about his thoughts on the justice system. ""But despite these themes of poverty, mental health and a broken political system, the gig radiated joy and defiance."" Politics runs through almost everything in Webster's music. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's tub-thumping agitpop. In the song Something To Eat, Webster manages to sing a catchy chorus about the ""Brexit scam"", while the video for his ostensibly anti-war song How Do You Sleep At Night? features snippets of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Margaret Thatcher (plus Tony Blair for a bit of balance). His recent single Voice of the Voiceless was praised in the House of Commons by John McDonnell, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's former shadow chancellor. ""In an ideal world, I'd just be writing about all the beautiful things in life,"" Webster says. ""There are some of them, and I do try. But sometimes you just get bogged down with what's going on around you. ""People say to me sometimes, 'Just stick to the music, leave the politics to the politicians'. And my answer to that is, well they're not doing the best job of it as far as I can see. And the second answer is, life is political. Whether you know it or not, politics are affecting how your life is lived."" Being stridently anti-government and anti-establishment, he preaches to the choir in Liverpool, and has gained big followings elsewhere. ""What I'm saying is, just a bit of compassion for the fellow human being would be a start. That's all I'm trying to say in my music."" However, if you don't love Webster, his outspoken stance may well be alienating or even offensive. There is the matter of the anti-Conservative chants that go up, and that he leads, at his live shows. ""Obviously, there's a chant that is synonymous with me and my gigs, 'Eff the Tories',"" he says. ""But I'd just like to say, that didn't come from me. That's been a stronghold in the north of England at gigs and at football matches, for a long time, right? ""And I just amplified it because I agree with it, you know, and that's just me and my personal political opinion, which I'm entitled to."" When a Labour MP endorsed the chant on social media after seeing him at a festival in Warrington, it led the chairman of the local Conservative Party to describe it as ""hate speech"". ""I do get criticism because of how maybe tribal I am, because of how blunt I am, because of how edgy I am. I do speak from the heart. And I find it hard to put a filter on things at times,"" Webster says. ""If you like me, great, I like you. If you don't like me, it's not really my problem, you know what I mean? I know I'm trying to do a good thing and I know I make people happy with my music. ""I do realise, and I've been told by management, my mum and my fiancee, that this 'Eff the Tories' thing is going to become a problem,"" he admits. ""But to me, rule number one of showbusiness is give the people what they want."" The political and footballing connections will clearly prove a barrier to Ed Sheeran-esque stardom, but they have fed into his status in Liverpool. Webster became only the second local artist to headline the city's arena, after Sir Paul McCartney. That show, in 2022, was a sell-out and he had to cut his set short because of crowd congestion. He is now planning his biggest show yet, in the 40,000-capacity Sefton Park in July. Last year's two outdoor shows set a high bar, even if they were both different experiences - the first was a beautiful summer's night, the second a torrential storm. ""The stage was soaking wet, I was soaking wet."" The bloke who swam in, obviously, was also soaking wet. ""The crowd, God bless them, absolutely drenched,"" Webster continues. ""And what a night we had. It was just a party, a proper Scouse party. ""We could have had a tidal wave coming in off the Mersey and we would have still been trying to fight our way through it. It was defiance and euphoria and adrenaline just balled up into this big massive gig. ""I felt like the city was mine. No, in fact I felt like the city was ours, you know what I mean? More so, I felt like the world was ours at that point."" The world remains unconquered, but his home town has been.

hide caption Allie Phillips, 28, is running to represent Tennessee's District 75. She also cares for four children at her in-home daycare in Clarksville during the week. The path to Tennessee politics for Allie Phillips began last year in her doctor's office. She was 19 weeks pregnant when she got the devastating news about her unborn daughter: only two of the four chambers in her heart were formed. It was one of many severe congenital issues. The fetus was incompatible with life. Phillips is 28. She and her husband already have a 6-year-old daughter. They had picked out a name for her sister: Miley Rose. Phillips already knew there were complications with the pregnancy, and she had been bargaining with the universe for days leading up to this appointment. Maybe there would be treatment for whatever condition her daughter had. A transplant. A cure, even. That was not the case. The doctor laid out the options. The first was to stay pregnant and brace for a likely miscarriage. The second was to terminate the pregnancy – at the time, Tennessee had a near-total abortion ban, though it has since added some narrow exceptions. So going out of state was the only possibility. ""She couldn't offer me any resources,"" Phillips says. She and her husband would have to navigate the path forward alone. ""I felt like a very small person going through that situation."" Phillips and her husband live a modest life. Phillips runs a daycare out of her house, and her husband is a forklift mechanic. Flying out of state on a few days' notice wasn't something they could do with ease, so they started a fundraiser and asked friends and family for help. After days of frantic phone calls around the country, she made an appointment at a clinic in New York to have the procedure. When she got there, the fetal heartbeat had already stopped. She was in danger of becoming septic. ""I'm very thankful for that clinic because they treated me like a human being,"" Phillips says. ""Unlike my state did."" When she returned home, grieving and angry, two things happened quickly. The first was that she joined a number of other women who, with the help of the Center for Reproductive Rights, are suing Tennessee in hopes of changing the state's austere laws. The second is that she decided it wasn't enough simply to keep telling her story – though she had been posting every moment on TikTok ""because I wanted people to see what somebody has to go through when they live in a state like Tennessee."" She needed to do more to change the law. Now, Phillips is in a political race that is being closely watched by people all over the country as a stress test for the Republican party on abortion rights. She didn't go looking for it; the opportunity came to her. One person who had seen her on TikTok was Charles Uffelman, head of Montgomery County Democrats. He had been watching her tell her story and says, ""I was pretty inspired by it."" Then, he says, he did a double take. ""I realized, she lives here. She lives in Clarksville."" Allie Phillips' living room mantle is dedicated to Miley Rose and decorated with gifts from friends, family and TikTok followers.

hide caption Allie Phillips' living room mantle is dedicated to Miley Rose and decorated with gifts from friends, family and TikTok followers. At first, Uffelman recruited Phillips just to get involved with the Democratic Party. Eventually, he asked her to run for a Tennessee House seat in District 75. Standing in democratic headquarters in Montgomery County, an hour outside Nashville, he's surrounded by campaign signs and fliers. He points to a map of his districts. They're not as blue as Nashville, but not as red as most of the state. ""The fight for breaking the super majority is gonna run through the suburbs,"" says Uffelman, tracing his finger along the Montgomery County line. Tennessee is one of nearly 20 states that have a Republican supermajority, with large majorities in both legislative chambers and control of the governor's office. Breaking that supermajority – that's what victory would look like for Tennesse Democrats. Phillips' district is one that Democrats have identified as flippable. Whether or not Democrats gain this seat in November may come down to voters like Jodi O'Connor, who also lives in Clarksville. ""I have conservative values. I believe in Jesus Christ and all that,"" she says. ""But that doesn't make me not want to have equal rights and, and rights for women."" O'Connor is a realtor. She's 67 and voted for Trump, but she likes to call herself a ""republicrat"" — historically she's supported candidates from both parties. This year, Phillips' race is pulling her to the left. ""Allie's got the vision and the and the, you know, the drive,"" O'Connor says. ""Hopefully she will win."" O'Connor says she's still in disbelief that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, repealing federal protection for abortion. That was a right she grew up with. She's relieved a member of Generation Z is picking up the fight. ""That is what it's going to take,"" she says, to win back reproductive rights. Phillips' platform is pegged to abortion rights, but she also wants to fight for gun safety and improve education. Her opponent, incumbent candidate Jeff Burkhart, declined to be interviewed for this story. He's been quiet on the issue of abortion. ""I would recommend to any of our Republican candidates to just stay away from the issue,"" says Doug Englen, with the Montgomery County Republican Party. He says donations have been strong lately. Party leadership is feeling good about their platform focusing on schools and business. Abortion, he says, is not a productive topic for them. They've made their position clear in local and national messaging. ""You don't have to answer the questions that are entrapping,"" Englen says. That mirrors a stance Republicans are taking across the state and the country. And it's one that some are questioning. ""It poses a problem for the Republicans,"" says John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. His polling shows most Americans — even in conservative Tennessee — want reproductive rights, including the choice to end a pregnancy that isn't viable. ""Republicans want them. MAGA-ites want them. Yet the state legislature is not inclined to do that,"" Geer says. ""If indeed Allie Phillips beats the incumbent, that would send a very strong signal."" Philips doesn't even have to win to send a message to the Republican Party, Geer says. Even coming close could send a shock through the system. Allie Phillips, 28, discusses homework with her 6-year-old daughter, Adalie, at their home in Clarksville, Tenn.

But Phillips says it's for the sake of her daughter's reproductive rights that she's doing it. ""It's my job as a mother to take care of my daughter and keep her safe,"" she says.

https://www.businessinsider.com/zelenskyy-radical-republican-rhetoric-terrifies-ukrainians-2024-1,"       The Republican Party has politicized critical US aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the radical rhetoric terrifies his people. ""There are definitely some voices, radical voices from the Republican party, and they are straining Ukrainian society,"" Zelenskyy said during a group interview at Davos on Tuesday with outlets including Business Insider. ""Sometimes we are surprised, and sometimes society is just afraid,"" he said. The Ukrainian leader said that he reckons that ""risqué slogans"" are just a part of US politics. But, he continued, ""it's so painful for people in Ukraine, it's so sensitive."" ""During the war, you know, everything is more painful,"" Zelenskyy added. ""Some radical voices are just stressing us out. They're scaring the public,"" he said. ""That's why I really want it very much to be just the opinion of singular voices and not that of a large part of the Republicans."" Zelenskyy appeared to be referring to a contingent of GOP lawmakers who have loudly denounced US support for Ukraine, as well as Republicans in Congress who have been holding a roughly $111 billion aid package hostage since October 2023 in order to pass stricter border and immigration policies. Some of the more vocal opponents of sending more money to Kyiv, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, told 60 Minutes in April 2023, that ""Ukraine is not the 51st state of the United States."" Greene said the US should instead be focusing on its out of control debt and immigration. Others House GOP officials, like Rep. Lauren Boebert, have said that the US has already sent too much money and suggested that it doesn't know where that aid is actually going. That type of inflammatory rhetoric, along with the current roadblock in Congress, has put Ukraine on edge. The US is by far the biggest single contributor of security assistance to Ukraine, and turning off the tap could spell, as Zelenskyy has warned, disaster for Ukraine's on the battlefield. It could have other consequences, he has said, including the an emboldened Russia starting conflicts with other nations. But Zelenskyy appears to recognize that strong rhetoric, no matter how hurtful or problematic, is just part of how US politics work, particularly in election years. Zelenskyy said that when he actually meets with US lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, much of that falls away. ""This is because of what I feel — when I'm in the United States, or when members of the Congress, senators, representatives of both parties visit us, and they sit at the table with me, and we talk, and I've never heard of no aid whatsoever."" Out in the open, though, the rhetoric remains, and aid to Ukraine is still in danger. Translations by Dmytro Yakubovskyy. Global Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Carlson contributed to this report.

hide caption Concertina wire lines the path as members of Congress tour an area near the Texas-Mexico border, Jan. 3, 2024, in Eagle Pass, Texas. WASHINGTON — A politically treacherous dynamic is taking hold as negotiators in Congress work to strike a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration, with vocal opposition from the hard right and former President Donald Trump threatening to topple the carefully negotiated compromise.Senators are closing in on the details of an agreement on border measures that could unlock Republican support for Ukraine aid and hope to unveil it as soon as next week. But the deal is already wobbling, as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces intense pressure from Trump and his House allies to demand more sweeping concessions from Democrats and the White House.""I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people,"" Trump posted on social media this week.It's a familiar political dynamic, one that has repeatedly thwarted attempts to reform U.S. immigration law, including in 2013 when House Republicans sought to pin illegal immigration on a Democratic president and in 2018 when Trump helped sink another bipartisan effort. The path for legislation this time around is further clouded by an election year in which Trump has once again made railing against illegal immigration a central focus of his campaign.Even though the terms of the policy negotiations have shifted significantly in the Republicans' direction, skepticism is running high among conservatives, creating a precarious moment that could determine not only the contours of U.S. immigration and border law for years to come, but the future of Ukraine as it faces dwindling U.S. supplies in its fight against Russia.President Joe Biden is pressing lawmakers to say yes. During a White House meeting this week with congressional leaders that was meant to underscore how desperately Ukraine needs funding, the president said he was ready for a ""big deal on the border.""The president has reason to want an agreement. The historic number of migrants who have come to the U.S. border with Mexico during Biden's term is seen as one of the largest political vulnerabilities in his re-election campaign.During Iowa's Republican caucuses last week, which Trump won, immigration was a top issue. An AP VoteCast survey found about 9 in 10 caucusgoers backed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 7 in 10 expressing strong support for the idea. As asylum seekers have made their way across the country, often by the busloads to Democratic-leaning cities as part of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's program, they have strained the resources and political tolerance of areas that will be vital to Biden's re-election chances.""It's gotten to the point where, in a way, everybody's back is against the wall,"" said Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat. ""I'm not talking about politically, I mean, substantively, these are challenges that the country can't ignore.""Bennet was joined at the Capitol on Thursday by Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat who told reporters that the recent influx of migrants has caused ""a humanitarian crisis and a fiscal crisis unlike anything we've seen in the last 25 years.""Democrats in Congress are split on the merits of the Senate package. Progressive and Hispanic lawmakers decry changes that would toughen the process for claiming asylum in the United States. Still, many Democrats say that Johnson's resistance to bipartisan compromise shows that Republicans aren't serious about solving the problems at the border.""They basically want to make sure that the situation is as chaotic as possible so that they can win elections in November,"" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat. ""That is their strategy. It's not a sincere attempt to do something about what's going on at the border.""Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, has been strongly making the case for the deal. He's told fellow Republicans that the border package, which he insisted be paired with Biden's $110 billion request for war aid for Ukraine, Israel and other national security priorities, is a rare opportunity to get stronger policies through Congress.The proposal crafted by the Senate would toughen the asylum process with a goal of cutting the number of migrants who come to the southern border to make an asylum claim.Negotiators have worked on some policies intended to aid immigrants. The plan could include a pathway to citizenship for Afghans who came during the U.S. withdrawal from their country, along with work permits for migrants who enter the asylum system, according to two people familiar with the talks who were granted anonymity to discuss the private negotiations.But the package will mostly leave out broad immigration changes, like protections for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children, that have been foundational in previous Senate bills.""It will be by far the most conservative border security bill in four decades,"" said Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead GOP negotiator.Lankford and other Senate Republicans have urged their House colleagues to remain open-minded. They argue that the changes would actually pave the way for Trump to implement his border agenda if he wins the election. Lankford has also said that the legislation would not dramatically reduce the number of migrants at the border for months — a tacit signal that border security could remain a top issue through the election.Still, Johnson has argued that a hardline House bill, H.R. 2 which passed the chamber in May without a single Democratic vote, is the solution to America's border woes. It would create a sweeping system intended to bottle up illegal immigration.Johnson has also made clear that he has been speaking regularly with Trump.""We're not playing politics with this, we're demanding real, transformative policy change,"" Johnson said this week.Even beyond Trump, Johnson is dealing with far-right House members who are furious over his willingness to work with Democrats to pass legislation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, has threatened to trigger a motion to oust Johnson if he brings a border bill with Ukraine aid to the House floor.Greene this week said Trump is backing the House conservatives' plan because ""it brings back all of his strong border policies."" In December, she said that passing bipartisan border legislation would only give Biden an opportunity to tout the legislation on the campaign trail.""I've been telling everyone that President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party,"" Greene said. ""That decisive victory in Iowa should be the shot across the bow to every single Republican that's elected.""Despite the pressure, Johnson signaled some support for the legislative push after a meeting this week at the White House, calling the talks ""productive."" But what he does next remains to be seen.Rep.

Lauren Goode Michael Calore It's an election year in the US, which means you can expect a fresh tsunami of campaign ads in your feeds, in your inbox, and jammed in front of YouTube videos. This is also the first election of the AI era, where anyone can generate just about anything—an image, a Twitter bot, a speech—by typing a few lines of text into a prompt. Whether it's bad actors generating misleading deepfakes or candidates using text generators to write cringey campaign emails, AI is now firmly part of the election process. This week on Gadget Lab, WIRED senior politics writer Makenna Kelly joins us en route from the Iowa caucus to talk about how scammers and political campaigns alike are using AI to influence voters at the polls.

Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Lauren Goode: Are you ready for 2024? Michael Calore: Aren't we already in 2024? Lauren Goode: No, no, no. I mean the event of 2024, the US presidential election? Michael Calore: Oh God. No, I'm not ready. Do I have a choice? Lauren Goode: No pun intended. Choice? Michael Calore: OK. See what you did there? Lauren Goode: Yeah. No, you really don't have one. We are barreling towards November 2024, and not to bring everything on this show back to artificial intelligence, but I think it's safe to say that that is going to play a role in this year's election. Michael Calore: Oh, gosh. I am afraid. Lauren Goode: Yep. We should talk about it. Michael Calore: OK, let's do it. [Gadget Lab intro theme music plays] Lauren Goode: Let's do it. Hi everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED. Michael Calore: And I'm Michael Calore. I'm the Director of Consumer Tech and Culture at WIRED. Lauren Goode: Oh, your new title. Michael Calore: Yeah, fancy new title. I'm going to have to get used to saying that. Lauren Goode: We are also joined this week by WIRED senior politics writer, Makena Kelly. Welcome to the show for the first time, Makena. Makena Kelly: Hey, it's good to be here. And what a time to join after the first caucus this week. Lauren Goode: Yeah, right now you are joining us from a safe space in the Atlanta Airport. Makena Kelly: Yes. Lauren Goode: Thank you for making the effort to join us while you're in transit. Makena Kelly: No, honestly, I'm playing with some new lactation room apps. It's actually wildly techy, more techy than I was expecting to find a room to do this in. Lauren Goode: Maybe we should just make the show about your review of that, the Mamava pods, but we should probably talk about Iowa too. OK. So since everyone got their feel of gadgets on last week's CES episode of Gadget Lab, this week we're headed back to reality. It's time to talk about politics. OK. So before you turn off this podcast because you're sick of hearing about politics, you really should stick around because we're going to give you some of the most clear-cut information you can get on how exactly AI is going to play a role in this year's election. I think you're going to walk away from this podcast smarter, more informed, and probably slightly dismayed. So this year is an election year in the US. Just this week was the Iowa caucus where surprise, surprise, former President, Donald Trump won the nomination for the Republican nominee for President. Let's talk about that first, and then we're going to come back to AI after that. Makena, you're deep in election coverage already. How are you holding up? Makena Kelly: Well, that's a really good question. I spent all of last night in Iowa running around events. I think I got up and out the door on the road at 7:00 A.M., and then I was out of a Vivek event, and then I went to a Don Jr. event and Don Jr. didn't show. And anyways, this all culminated into the votes happening, and I have not slept for 32 hours at this point. So I'm very excited to get home. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Lauren Goode: Yeah, we're excited for you to get a nap on that flight home and hopefully a deep night's sleep after that. For people who don't know, quickly, how exactly does the Iowa caucus work? Makena Kelly: Right, so it's not different from any other primary in each state. Iowa, of course, is the first. The Democratic Party is trying to change that and bring that to South Carolina now for them, but in Iowa, for Republican caucus, essentially what happens is people in these precincts, kind of like districts, they show up to their precincts with all of the people in their communities. And unlike the Democratic caucus in Iowa, the Republicans cast these secret ballots after having what I heard from talking to voters last night, very cordial conversations with one another, and they file their ballots, the ballots are counted, and then the precinct is decided for whatever candidate gets the most votes. Michael Calore: So what sort of demographic representation are there at the caucuses? Because it seems like when people go to the ballot box or when people show up to have these discussions, it might be two different types of people we're talking about. Makena Kelly: Sure. When I was traveling around this week, I think we have this idea in our head of what an early voter, a caucus voter, an early primary voter looks like, and it's typically maybe an older person, someone over 50 who has maybe been engaged in the political process a little bit longer than others. But I also did run into a lot of young people as well, many people who are out caucusing for the first time, even if they just hadn't turned 17, 18. And some people I talked to had caucused for the first time, and I think they were 34. So people were coming out from all over for this one, and I think it's just because of the candidates. But yeah, we can get to that. Lauren Goode: Yeah, you've been TikToking and Threading a lot over the past few days, and it seems like a lot of the constituents you saw there in Iowa are in fact pretty young. And it seems like the Republican Party has done a good job of galvanizing young voters. These also tend to be pretty tech-savvy voters. Do you have a sense of how many of the folks you talk to, if any of them consider tech policy to be an important part of this election cycle? Makena Kelly: Sure. So I might have a poor view of the entire party. I spent a lot of my time the past couple of days tracking Vivek Ramaswamy, who famously, Chris Christie called a man who sounds like ChatGPT in the August debate. So yes, there were a bunch of tech-savvy kids there. I talked to some kids who were 17, 21, people in college, young parents. And when you talk about tech-savvy for them, I don't know if they're necessarily thinking about AI every waking moment of the day, but they are excited about people like Vivek and other candidates who are reaching them through the types of media that they consume, whether that be TikTok or Instagram and other social media platforms. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Michael Calore: So in the past few elections, obviously Twitter and Facebook have played an outsized role in not only candidates having discussions with people online, but also outreach and campaigning happening on those platforms. Are those platforms still powerful tools or are things like TikTok and even Instagram Threads also making a play this year? Makena Kelly: OK, so maybe I'm biased, but my whole, I don't know, magnum opus, what I'm following this year is really this fragmentation that we're seeing on social media and how that is affecting the democratic process. With Elon Musk buying X, Twitter, whatever, I'm calling it Twitter, and turning that into increasingly a right wing cesspool, and then TikTok of course, becoming really popular, not just with the young people who are engaging with it every day, you're seeing a lot of Democrats on there. I know Bernie was popular in 2020, but you're seeing different members of different parties and their audiences going to different platforms at this point in time. And of course, we had Truth Social and these alternative social media sites. Truth has really just become a megaphone for Trump and Gettr and Parlor, and all of those are dead. But still, that fragmentation that I think that they were inspired by or excited by those platforms is still making its way through the things that we're more familiar with, like Instagram and Twitter now. Lauren Goode: What does that fragmentation mean ultimately? If someone gravitates towards the app where they know they're going to hear exactly what they want to hear, then isn't that creating the famous echo chamber? Makena Kelly: Sure. And I also think it's partially having to do with policy. So when you look at the Republican Party, they are very aggressive on China. The Chinese government's association with ByteDance, which owns TikTok, you won't see a lot of Republicans on the app, solely I think basically for a policy reason. I think Vivek was really the only Republican, major Republican I say as he walks away with less than 8 percent of the vote last night, but he was really the only person trying to reach young people there. I think he saw an opportunity in that app to be the first adopter in the party, whereas we've seen Bernie was doing TikToks, and when I say doing TikToks, he wasn't dancing. That would be ridiculous, but doing his little Bernie shtick that he's been doing for how many decades, just through a TikTok lens. And Fetterman, John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, he really played TikTok and a bunch of social platforms really well in the... What was it? How many years has this been now? The 2022 midterms. Right? And so yeah, I think part of it has to do policy-wise. I think also, it's just older people. I don't think you see Chuck Grassley, the oldest Senator in the Senate right now. He'll do push-ups on Instagram, but he's not going to be dancing to whatever Charli D'Amelio was doing and stuff like that. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Lauren Goode: He's not getting the special D'Amelio Dunkin' Donuts drink or anything and flexing it on TikTok? Makena Kelly: No, he likes to get his blizzards at Dairy Queen and whatever you know what is, if you remember that tweet. Lauren Goode: How exactly are candidates using AI in their campaign so far? Makena Kelly: Sure. So I think it's really interesting, mostly because like we saw with TikTok and all of these apps in 2020 post pandemic, after the pandemic started of course, and we're in the heat of the 2020 presidential election, you can't really do retail politics anymore. All of these venues were shut down. You can't see people and shake hands. And so campaigns really had to adapt quickly to the internet. Bernie was doing livestreams. Joe Biden also did livestreams, and they started off really, really bad. He had a kind of garbled one, if I remember correctly, similar to DeSantis' X announcement, Twitter space that he did. Lauren Goode: Oh, right. Makena Kelly: Do you remember that? Lauren Goode: Yeah, there were terrible technical difficulties. Yeah. Makena Kelly: Right. So what we saw in 2020 with this quick adoption, people having to carve out a playbook quickly on how you do this, how you do it right, with a lot of opportunity to be cringe. And we saw a lot of cringe in 2022. And so what we're seeing with AI right now actually is kind of similar. So AI of course, has been in whatever political software as has been in whatever software in any industry, right? Forever. But when it comes to generative AI, what we're seeing is a lot of playfulness, people experimenting. I think a lot of the campaign emails we're going to get soon are going to be created in... If not in ChatGPT, there's a lot of startups that are working right now to create their own similar text generation thing where you feed in your best campaign emails, the ones that got you the most clicks, the most opens, the most donations. You feed that text into these models. Quiller is one that has really taken off so far. That's the app that I think it's in its beta phase right now, but there's a lot of excitement right now in the Democratic Party for it. But you feed in your best emails and then they'll give you out a simple draft of what it is that this next one that's coming up should look like, depending on who you're targeting, what you're doing, what you're asking for, and it's a lot easier. Instead of sending you know what, lower level junior staffer to sit there and write an email, that could take an hour. If they're able to just ask for one, get it delivered and edit it, that takes maybe like 20 minutes and it's saving a campaign a lot of time. And when I talk to campaigns, the two resources that they're always fighting for is A Money. We get text messages, we get emails, we get all of the calls asking for money. We're aware of that, but it's also time. And you have these staffers who want to spend more time connecting with voters, and if they could save that time when it comes to generating an email or a text message, they're looking to take it. So I think text generation's a really, really big one we're going to see. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Lauren Goode: Before we go to break, Mike, you had a question that we were going to save for the second half, but it is a really good one about speeches. Michael Calore: Oh yeah. So Makena, have you seen a speech yet where you're thinking, ""OK, ChatGPT wrote this?"" Makena Kelly: OK, you want to know what? I think most of Trump's speeches sound like AI, but it's just him. I don't know if you have watched enough of those that it's like, ""Where is this coming from?"" I feel like Trump's brain works like a large language model sometimes, just hallucinating, spinning stuff out that doesn't make quite a lot of sense. But yeah, no, nothing in specific, but I have taken to, when I see a campaign email that comes by, I used to... When ChatGPT, OpenAI had that check to see if this was AI January, I used to throw those in there and see if they were, and I haven't found one that had a really close to 90 percent likelihood that it was AI generated. So that was months ago. And so I think we're going to see a lot of that crop up now too, especially as people start hitting the trail outside of the presidential election as well. We still have House people up for election. We still have Senate elections up, and those are going to be the people who are going to be short for resources, right? Biden is always going to have a lot of money. Trump is always going to have a lot of money. All the national candidates have... The Koch brothers, whoever behind them, and you're going to see people, especially insurgent candidates, doing some creative stuff in the next year or so. Lauren Goode: All right, let's take a quick break and then we'll come back with more. [Break] Lauren Goode: OK. So there has obviously been a lot of concern about disinformation in the media during election seasons. We talked about this earlier this year... Was it last year? Last year with our colleague, David Gilbert, but this 2024 cycle is poised to hit a new level. This is the generative AI era where images and voices and videos can all just be manufactured almost instantly by anyone. Whether they depict something true or something completely made up. It's going to make for a very strange uncanny election season. So Makena, we know that companies like OpenAI do have policies in place that are supposed to prevent campaigns or campaign managers from using ChatGPT to just spit out tons and tons and tons of campaign messaging using AI, right? They're trying to keep this space as healthy as possible, but also, there are other products out there aside from ChatGPT, right? People are building other tools, there are workarounds. What are you seeing out in the field? Makena Kelly: Sure. I think it was Chris Christie who created that Donald Duck meme, the Donald Trump Duck thing with Chat or with a DALL-E a couple of months ago, and it was a really cringe meme. So they're doing that when it comes to content creation for sure, but when you're looking at things that might actually fool someone, I know the DeSantis super PAC never backed down, was just using what seemed to be the video and image generation tools in Adobe Premiere to create ads by just injecting fighter jets into the back of the skies that they had shot for an ad. So that's one thing. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Lauren Goode: What was the point of the fighter jets? Is that supposed to be- Makena Kelly: I think it's just- Lauren Goode: Manly, it's just testosterone. Makena Kelly: I think it was just “pro-America eagle screech” vibes. So we were seeing things like that. So even just Adobe is a huge tool for campaigns. And then a big thing happening, especially after 2008, and Obama won and used social media and tech really effectively, was people started getting into and creating specific tech products. And now we're seeing a bunch of startups, campaign tech startups like Quiller as I mentioned, but also a bunch of others that are creating their own large language models to serve campaigns. Democratic campaigns are the focus of it, what I'm seeing so far, but creating their own large language models that they can then charge campaigns a lot of money for and not have the types of rules that OpenAI does because well, OpenAI has all of these rules because they don't want to be liable for a lot of the content that campaigns make. Well, if you're working with a Democratic AI tech vendor, I'm assuming that they're probably fine with you doing typical political campaign stuff, especially because they're typically smaller companies, startups that don't have as much heat on them as a huge company like OpenAI in this moment. Lauren Goode: It's also very expensive to build your own LLM. So I imagine that they must be using some open source foundational model first and then building some app on top of that? Makena Kelly: That's what I'm assuming. But honestly, from covering this beat for as many years as I'm doing it now, campaigns are pretty techie. Talk about thinking and considering how to use AI ethically and effectively in a campaign. I was reminded that Biden 2020 has a Director of Engineering, and I talked to him the other week and I was like, ""Oh yeah, campaigns have Directors of Engineering, they have people who are working on huge tech products, building infrastructure for campaigns. Now, this is mostly national campaigns, but those folks are out there and it's a huge part of just running any old campaign, whether it be every two years, six years or four years. Michael Calore: Well, still, the campaigns can't just do whatever they want because they are also being watched by federal election officials and state election officials. In what ways have the governing bodies that oversee elections put any sort of guardrails up around generative AI tools? Makena Kelly: That is where I think I would interject a sad trombone sound at this moment because the Federal Elections Commission, like you mentioned, would be the agency in charge here, and they have not done too much when it comes to regulating elections for a very long time. And so recently, when we saw those DeSantis ads go up and we saw campaigns starting to toy with AI and image generation, video generation, all that kind of stuff in their ads, people of course got a little upset and were like, ""Well, is there a disclosure anywhere?"" When I hear a... And now we're all going to hear them for the next year, but when I see an ad on television and it's paid by a super PAC, that needs to be disclosed at the end. It's, ""This ad was paid for by Ron DeSantis or Never Backed Down, or America First,"" or whatever all those super PACs are, that has to be disclosed at the end. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Right now under federal law, you can just have the eagle screeching fighter jets thrown in the back of your ad and not even tell people that they're fake. And so there's been a handful of petitions. I know Public Citizen as one, they're an election watchdog group, has tried to petition the FEC to create rules requiring similar disclosures when it comes to AI generation and ads, but it hasn't moved anywhere. Representative Yvette Clarke from New York, and then Senator Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota, they have worked on a bill to institute that at the legislative level, not going anywhere right now either. And I think when we have these conversations about tech, whether it's in elections or just tech policy, these things never really tend to happen until something really breaks. And even then, when we're thinking of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, Meta, whatever, nothing really came of that either. And so sadly, I think people are waiting almost for the system to break, for something to go really, really, really, really wrong before people act because yeah, we're heading into election year. A lot of the people who are legislators are now up for election, and maybe that's their main priority right now. Michael Calore: I feel like most people have a really good bullshit meter when it comes to deep fakes and memes, videos that show politicians saying something that they didn't really say, or a meme that makes it look like they said a quote that they didn't actually say or passing along some sort of message or supporting a particular group. I feel like most people in the United States would see that and they'd say, ""Ah, that doesn't really feel right."" And if it's outrageous, like you were saying, the really big things that break the system, then that makes news and then more people are talking about it and it undermines that sort of tactic to discredit somebody or to make them appear as though they said something they didn't say. As the tools are getting better, that's probably a harder line to define. As things look better and as the videos are more convincing and as the memes are more convincing, then it becomes harder for people to make that decision themselves, right? Makena Kelly: Sure. And at that point, who are we relying on? We're relying on the platforms to enforce their policies. We've seen how that's gone in multiple election cycles. And then also, when I think about... We talk about deepfakes being relatively easy to spot. There's two things, and one was, I don't know if anybody remembers, but the Nancy Pelosi drunk video on Facebook where she was apparently slurring her words. That wasn't even a deepfake, that was just someone slowing down a video in a way that I think... For me, I spend what? Every day on the internet, every hour of every day. I can spot that, but someone who's maybe older, someone who maybe wants to believe that that's what that is, they may be more susceptible. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill And to think about a really big scam going on right now are scammers using AI generated versions of someone's voice to call their elderly parents or whoever, and convince them that they're in trouble, they're in jail, they need bail money. ""Can you wire me bail money?"" Using this voice and you would think that you'd be able to tell that this is your loved one, this is your mother, your sister, your brother, and know their voice and know whether this is a fake AI generation, but people are falling for that too. So if you don't even know who your family member is, if you can't even recognize that difference, then I think it's hard for someone to recognize the difference with maybe someone they just hear in soundbites on the internet or on the news. Lauren Goode: And that is the part I mentioned earlier where you might leave this podcast feeling a bit dismayed. We have to leave it there, and unfortunately we're not going to come to all of the solutions on this one episode. But Makena, this has been super informative. We really appreciate you joining us, once again, from an airport. Stick around because after the break we're going to do our recommendations. [Break] Lauren Goode: All right, Makena, as our guest of honor, what is your recommendation this week? Makena Kelly: OK, so I didn't have a lot of time to think about this, but the one thing that really saved my life, I don't know if anyone was paying attention, but Iowa was very cold the past couple of days. On Sunday, it got to -19 when I left my hotel, and I was very grateful for Uniqlo Underlayers, their HeatTech. Those really saved my life, the pants, the shirt. I'm really, really glad that I brought those. Michael Calore: Are those the kind that have the reflective material on the inside and it reflects body heat back to you? Makena Kelly: Yes. I think that's what it does. I just wear them underneath my clothes and I was a little warm. I think the coldest part of me were my toes and I had to go buy new socks at Target after some event. Lauren Goode: How much do these base layers cost? Makena Kelly: I think they can't cost too much. It is Uniqlo, and I know that... I feel like I love Uniqlo because the clothing there is typically very affordable. And from the stuff that I bought, it lasts a while. I wish I knew the price, but this is something that my husband gets all of our family members for Christmas every year, and I am always eternally grateful for it. Lauren Goode: That's a very good gift. That's thoughtful. Thoughtful man. Makena Kelly: He's really good at practical gifts. Lauren Goode: Yeah, yeah, base layers. Well, hopefully when you get a little downtime after all this campaign coverage, you can go on a ski trip or something and use them. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Makena Kelly: So actually, funny story, my husband's aunt has a ski house in New Hampshire and she is begging me to come out to the primaries, so I am really considering it because I've never skied before and I would really like to learn. Lauren Goode: Well, don't break a leg. That's all I got to say, but that sounds delightful. Well, thank you for that recommendation, Makena. Mike, what's your recommendation this week? Michael Calore: I'm going to recommend a television show. It just wrapped, so the entire thing is available to stream. It's called The Curse, and it is on Showtime, which I think is now also called Paramount+, but I'm just going to keep calling it Showtime. They have to stop changing the names of things. Lauren Goode: I know. Michael Calore: So The Curse is a new show from the minds of Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie. So it is extremely cringe, the whole show. It will just make you deeply uncomfortable in absolutely the best way. The stars of the show are Nathan Fielder and Emma Stone, who's having a moment. We love Emma Stone. This show cements her as possibly the greatest actress of her generation. Her performance in it is fantastic. The story, I won't give too much away, it's about a couple that does a reality show for an HDTV style network. It's called Flipanthropy, where they buy old properties in their hometown in ex-urban Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's a community where it's run down. There's a lot of indigenous people living in the community, and they are trying really, really hard not to be the white gentrifiers. They're deeply selfish people. So of course, they fail at that and they fail at almost everything, and the show takes a couple of very unexpected, dramatic turns. It is funny, it is difficult to watch, and the ending is absolutely the best ending of any TV show that I've seen in recent memory. Lauren, I know you just started watching it. Lauren Goode: I did, first episode. Michael Calore: And if you have not started watching it, I will recommend, in addition to recommending watching the show, do not read about the show, because if you read about the show, it will probably spoil the ending for you because the ending was so divisive and so wild. There's a lot of ink being written right now this week, the week of the 15th, about the ending, which just aired. So if you're starting to watch The Curse, go on Curse media blackout as best you can until you finish it, and then read all of them and tweet at me and tell me what you think. Lauren Goode: That's a great recommendation. I actually subscribed to Paramount+ just to watch it, and I have seven days for free trial, but I'm super busy this week. So I'm like, ""Oh, no. Can I fit in the whole season in seven days?"" I probably can't. Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica Simon Hill Christopher Null Simon Hill Michael Calore: It's 10 episodes. Lauren Goode: No, I definitely can't then. Paramount+ has me in their clutches now. Michael Calore: Yeah. Well, get through as much of it as you can and then pay the 10 bucks to finish it. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Well, thank you for that, Mike. Michael Calore: Sure. Lauren Goode: Also, Benny Safdie is your doppelganger. Michael Calore: Do you think I look like him? Lauren Goode: Yeah. And it took me a moment to realize... It took me almost the entire first episode to realize that was Benny Safdie. I was like, ""Oh my God."" Michael Calore: Yeah, good physical- Lauren Goode: Total greaseball producer. Michael Calore: Physical transformation. He's very good on the show. Everybody's very good on the show. Anyway, what is your recommendation? Lauren Goode: My recommendation is also a TV show. It's called, I'm very behind on this, Catastrophe. When I started watching Catastrophe, because it was available on Amazon Prime Video and I was looking for something to watch that was half hour digestible episodes, I realized that it came out in 2015 and my brain did this thing where I thought, ""OK, it's just a few years old."" And I was like, ""Oh my God. That was almost a decade ago."" Now 2015 is almost a decade ago. What has happened? Anyway, it stars Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, who also write the show. They star as characters named Sharon and Rob. And the very first episode, they have a week-Long fling in London where Sharon's character is based and Rob is visiting on business, and it results in a pregnancy, an unplanned pregnancy, and they decide to move ahead with it and not only move ahead with it, but also, have a relationship, and eventually get married and build a family and move to London and deal with in-laws. And they just go all in. And the thing about both Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney is that they're both deeply funny, but heartfelt people, and I think the show really reflects that. There's four seasons and I can't believe I'm so late to this, because once again, the finale, a lot of ink was spilled on the finale because it ends in a ambiguous and slightly ominous way. But it's really good. And I'm glad, even though a lot of you listening, maybe you've already seen it because it's nearly 10 years old, I'm glad that I discovered this and I'm watching it late.

https://www.businessinsider.com/us-debt-crisis-deficits-spending-solutions-tax-consequences-inflation-interest-2024-1,"       The fiscal policies necessary to counter US overspending would be pretty simple to implement, if only there was political willpower to make it happen, Research Affiliates CEO Chris Brightman wrote on Thursday. ""Necessary fiscal reform is economically easy,"" his note said. ""Unfortunately, it's politically difficult."" Most or all of the federal deficit could be erased through adjustments to the Social Security program, as well as the introduction of a national value added tax, or VAT. Specifically, the government could find needed funding by raising the retirement age for Social Security benefits, as well as raising maximum income on Social Security taxes. Meanwhile, a nationwide VAT program could be enough to eliminate the US budget deficit by raising total tax receipts to a necessary level of 36% of GDP. Today, that figure stands at 32%, Brightman wrote. At any rate, some sort of action is needed as US deficit and debt levels are unsustainable over the long term, he emphasized. Total federal debt recently topped an all-time high of $34 trillion. ""[R]ising debt levels would, at some point, increase inflation and interest rates as well as depress real growth, thus worsening deficits and growth of the debt,"" he wrote, echoing similar alarm from Wall Street commentators. ""To repeat, the current fiscal path is unsustainable."" Even the government's own forecasts are flashing red. Brightman cited a 2022 Treasury Department report warning that fiscal policy had become unsustainable, and that debt-to-GDP would rise from 97% to 566% by the century's end without any changes. Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office expects the ratio to hit 181% by 2053. But leaders have yet to show a willingness to fix this, as deficit spending is among the many policies Democrats and Republicans are misaligned on, Brightman said. This was made extremely apparent last year, when partisan disagreement over spending cuts nearly risked a US debt default. Read next Jump to",politics,relevant,"Research Affiliates CEO Chris Brightman argues that the US could easily counter overspending through fiscal reform, including adjustments to the Social Security program and the introduction of a national value added tax (VAT).

https://time.com/6565036/nimbys-vs-yimbys/,"Young people are frustrated by the high cost of housing in places like San Franscico, and they are doing something about it. Victoria Fierce, for instance, moved to the Bay Area in 2015 from Akron, Ohio, in search of a job in tech. “I ended up sleeping on a friend’s couch until I could find my own place,” she told a Census Bureau reporter. It was a long wait. Chastened, she launched East Bay for Everyone in 2015, a citizens group that says “yes to more neighbors, more housing, more renter protections, better public transit, and better infrastructure in our backyards.” Fierce is part of a self-identified group demanding more, denser, cheaper, accessible housing, and they have created a very intentional acronym to express their desires: YIMBY, or “Yes In My Backyard.” A half century ago, activists in neighborhoods across the United States mobilized to protect what they considered to be their quality of life. The threats they battled ranged from traffic to resisting the denser housing that YIMBYs want more of today. The NIMBY (""Not In My Back Yard"") politics of the past was often motivated by the desire to protect property values, which in America was frequently infused with racial concerns. But the growth of NIMBY politics also was motivated by long-forgotten progressive agendas that sought to protect green space, preserve historic resources, and stop highways that threatened pollution and shattered communities. Read More: Why There Are No Houses to Buy in Many U.S. Metro Areas In fact, it was concern about unchecked development that earned it the NIMBY label. By 1970, advocates for growth, from highway engineers to housing developers, homed in on a single factor in the complex mix of motivations that drove neighborhood activists—their self-interest—and branded those parochial interests with the label “backyard.” By the 1980s, the pejorative NIMBY routinely was hurled at those trying to constrain growth and development. While YIMBYs see themselves as the opposite of NIMBYs, the similarities between the original NIMBYs and today’s YIMBYs are hard to miss. In both cases, people’s own self-interest has been a major catalyst for shaping their politics. And in most cases today, YIMBYs also pursue central themes of the progressive agenda—just like many of the NIMBYs from an earlier generation. Of course, that progressive agenda has shifted. So too, its methods. Direct citizen participation was an approach to politics shared by virtually all NIMBYs a half a century ago. Tens of thousands of citizens who previously had not been directly engaged in politics adapted strategies from the civil rights, women’s, and anti-Vietnam War movements. They began showing up at city council meetings, protesting, boycotting, and demanding a say in policies that affected them directly, creating a virtual tidal wave of direct participation in public affairs. When it came to issues, those policies that promised a better quality of life excited neighborhood activists. For example, when the General Electric Company announced in the early 1970s that it planned to build a new research and manufacturing facility in a predominantly white, well-heeled area of central Virginia—the “Ivy Valley”—a local newspaper asked, “GE Plant: Menace or Manna?” One opponent insisted, “For God’s sake, don’t start industry [in] that beautiful valley,” while an advocate countered: “All I see in that valley is . . . brush. . . . We need jobs. . . . This is dollars from heaven coming to us."" The shared concern for an improved quality of life was most obvious in the many local facets of the surging environmental movement. For example, activists sought to protect Green Springs, a rural historic district in a community near the “Ivy Valley,"" from a maximum security “diagnostic center” that would have crafted rehabilitation plans for every convicted felon in Virginia. “We only asked to farm our land, to rear our children, to live in peace with our many friends and neighbors, to enjoy the beauty of this God-given valley,” a farming couple wrote to the editor of the local paper.  Instead, they warned, they might soon look out on “high steel fences” restraining convicts. Read More: Why Suburban American Homeowners Were Accused of Being a 'Profit-Making Cartel' in the 1970s Did they worry about what a prison would do to their property values? You bet they did. Was that concern tinged with fears about the kind of people who might be incarcerated, and their families? Absolutely. But this couple had moved from the Norfolk area where the cost of farmland had become prohibitive due to uncontrolled suburban sprawl. Previously apolitical, the couple entered the political arena to preserve the peace, quiet, and the beauty they now enjoyed. As it turned out, the prison was not imposed on any community. But in many other battles waged by NIMBYs in the last third of the 20th century, costs associated with large-scale projects often were. And there is no question that whether that cost was a massive highway that literally split neighborhoods in two, or toxic waste, these “negative externalities""—the sanitized term that economists use to refer to those costs—were disproportionately imposed on poor communities and communities that consisted of people of color. The newly politically engaged neighborhood warriors ran head-on into enraged government officials and long-standing interest groups, that were used to building when and where they wanted to. In 1970, the New York Times quoted highway and public utility officials criticizing “backyard obstructionists.”  Frustrated officials working for highway departments and utilities pointed to pressing regional needs that these “backyard activists” were gumming up. “You know what I’ve begun to realize?” the head of the East Hudson Parkway Authority told the Times. “If the [interstate] highway system were just starting now, it couldn’t be built.” A variety of complex reasons for opposing a project were reduced to “not in my backyard.” An early use of that phrase appeared in the Newport News Daily Press in 1979. It was hurled by a retired Atomic Energy Commission official upset that the “NIMBY” syndrome might derail plans to dispose of nuclear waste. The acronym was soon weaponized—applied to virtually any group that challenged development. Selfish NIMBYs were blamed for halting progress as the rapid pace of exurban sprawl leveled everything in its path. One rural Virginia resident who stood to profit personally if W.R. Grace & Co. strip-mined in the 1970s voiced a typical charge against NIMBYs. He called mining opponents “a bunch of retirees, living on pensions and watching the world go by.” As for their claims that mining would damage what later was designated a National Historic Landmark (the same vaunted status as the Alamo) the district’s county supervisor told TIME that “Virginia is full of houses like that.” There are a variety of reasons for the spread of neighborhood activism, but the most basic one was success. Direct citizen participation in politics worked, especially in the wake of Watergate as the demand for transparency in government grew. This politics also was fueled by the recent mass movements of the 1960s and early 1970s, including the ideas of the New Left on college campuses who coined the phrase “participatory democracy.” Read More: Arizona Faces an Existential Dilemma: Import Water or End Its Housing Boom The environmental movement’s emphasis on quality of life—clean air, clean water, protecting nature while ensuring access to it—also made protection from toxic insults, or simply the construction of anything that threatened habitat, increasingly mainstream.  A new passion for historic preservation embodied in the Historic Preservation Act of 1966 fueled the creation of historic districts that soon protected thousands of neighborhoods against change. Now, it’s the non-home owners, especially in areas where the cost of housing is sky high, who are fighting back. Progressives, who a generation earlier would have questioned any development, today zero in on the dwindling supply of housing. They blame NIMBYs for that undersupply. Innovative conceptions of metropolitan life are gaining ground far beyond the Bay Area. As Bloomberg’s “City Lab” put it, “In 2023, zoning reform went national, thanks to advocacy by the pro-housing YIMBY…movement.” Back in California, Gov. Gavin Newsome signed 56 bills into law that addressed the housing crisis. After Virginia’s conservative governor promised to reduce regulations to stimulate housing production, the Virginia Mercury asked: Glenn Youngkin, YIMBY-in-chief? Despite the mutual accusations of self-interest, recognizing their common histories would serve NIMBYs and YIMBYs well. YIMBY members who acknowledge what the landscape might look like had NIMBYS not slowed down America’s rapacious land grab, should throw a little love in their direction. Highway engineers listen to citizens (sometimes) these days; housing developers can no longer build first and ask questions later. NIMBY members must recognize that history is rarely about freezing the past, rather, it is about change. That includes tearing down some of the fences that currently divide too many backyards. For good reason, YIMBYs have sponsored seminars on how to talk to NIMBYs. It’s a matter of self-interest.

https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit.html,"Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language — so the argument runs — must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes. Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English language as it is now habitually written. These five passages have not been picked out because they are especially bad — I could have quoted far worse if I had chosen — but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. They are a little below the average, but are fairly representative examples. I number them so that I can refer back to them when necessary: 1. I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien [sic] to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to tolerate. Professor Harold Laski (Essay in Freedom of Expression) 2. Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes egregious collocations of vocables as the Basic put up with for tolerate, or put at a loss for bewilder. Professor Lancelot Hogben (Interglossia) 3. On the one side we have the free personality: by definition it is not neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor dream. Its desires, such as they are, are transparent, for they are just what institutional approval keeps in the forefront of consciousness; another institutional pattern would alter their number and intensity; there is little in them that is natural, irreducible, or culturally dangerous. But on the other side, the social bond itself is nothing but the mutual reflection of these self-secure integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the very picture of a small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of mirrors for either personality or fraternity? Essay on psychology in Politics (New York) 4. All the ‘best people’ from the gentlemen's clubs, and all the frantic fascist captains, united in common hatred of Socialism and bestial horror at the rising tide of the mass revolutionary movement, have turned to acts of provocation, to foul incendiarism, to medieval legends of poisoned wells, to legalize their own destruction of proletarian organizations, and rouse the agitated petty-bourgeoise to chauvinistic fervor on behalf of the fight against the revolutionary way out of the crisis. Communist pamphlet 5. If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country, there is one thorny and contentious reform which must be tackled, and that is the humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C. Timidity here will bespeak canker and atrophy of the soul. The heart of Britain may be sound and of strong beat, for instance, but the British lion's roar at present is like that of Bottom in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream — as gentle as any sucking dove. A virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to be traduced in the eyes or rather ears, of the world by the effete languors of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as ‘standard English’. When the Voice of Britain is heard at nine o'clock, better far and infinitely less ludicrous to hear aitches honestly dropped than the present priggish, inflated, inhibited, school-ma'amish arch braying of blameless bashful mewing maidens! Letter in Tribune Each of these passages has faults of its own, but, quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose-construction is habitually dodged. DYING METAPHORS. A newly invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically ‘dead’ (e. g. iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: Ring the changes on, take up the cudgel for, toe the line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, no axe to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles’ heel, swan song, hotbed. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a ‘rift’, for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe the line is sometimes written as tow the line. Another example is the hammer and the anvil, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would avoid perverting the original phrase. OPERATORS OR VERBAL FALSE LIMBS. These save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are render inoperative, militate against, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, have the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc., etc. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, such as break, stop, spoil, mend, kill, a verb becomes a phrase, made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purpose verb such as prove, serve, form, play, render. In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (by examination of instead of by examining). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of the -ize and de- formations, and the banal statements are given an appearance of profundity by means of the not un- formation. Simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by such phrases as with respect to, having regard to, the fact that, by dint of, in view of, in the interests of, on the hypothesis that; and the ends of sentences are saved by anticlimax by such resounding commonplaces as greatly to be desired, cannot be left out of account, a development to be expected in the near future, deserving of serious consideration, brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and so on and so forth. PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like phenomenon, element, individual (as noun), objective, categorical, effective, virtual, basic, primary, promote, constitute, exhibit, exploit, utilize, eliminate, liquidate, are used to dress up a simple statement and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgements. Adjectives like epoch-making, epic, historic, unforgettable, triumphant, age-old, inevitable, inexorable, veritable, are used to dignify the sordid process of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic colour, its characteristic words being: realm, throne, chariot, mailed fist, trident, sword, shield, buckler, banner, jackboot, clarion. Foreign words and expressions such as cul de sac, ancien regime, deus ex machina, mutatis mutandis, status quo, gleichschaltung, weltanschauung, are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Except for the useful abbreviations i. e., e. g. and etc., there is no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in the English language. Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, subaqueous, and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon numbers(1). The jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (hyena, hangman, cannibal, petty bourgeois, these gentry, lackey, flunkey, mad dog, White Guard, etc.) consists largely of words translated from Russian, German, or French; but the normal way of coining a new word is to use Latin or Greek root with the appropriate affix and, where necessary, the size formation. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (deregionalize, impermissible, extramarital, non-fragmentary and so forth) than to think up the English words that will cover one's meaning. The result, in general, is an increase in slovenliness and vagueness. MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning(2). Words like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly ever expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality’, while another writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar deadness’, the reader accepts this as a simple difference opinion. If words like black and white were involved, instead of the jargon words dead and living, he would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused. The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’. The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like Marshal Petain was a true patriot, The Soviet press is the freest in the world, The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution, are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: class, totalitarian, science, progressive, reactionary, bourgeois, equality. Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions, let me give another example of the kind of writing that they lead to. This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from Ecclesiastes: I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. Here it is in modern English: Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account. This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3) above, for instance, contains several patches of the same kind of English. It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending of the sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations — race, battle, bread — dissolve into the vague phrases ‘success or failure in competitive activities’. This had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am discussing — no one capable of using phrases like ‘objective considerations of contemporary phenomena’ — would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The first contains forty-nine words but only sixty syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life. The second contains thirty-eight words of ninety syllables: eighteen of those words are from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six vivid images, and only one phrase (‘time and chance’) that could be called vague. The second contains not a single fresh, arresting phrase, and in spite of its ninety syllables it gives only a shortened version of the meaning contained in the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining ground in modern English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will occur here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of human fortunes, we should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence than to the one from Ecclesiastes. As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier — even quicker, once you have the habit — to say In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that than to say I think. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don't have to hunt about for the words; you also don't have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a hurry — when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech — it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind or a conclusion to which all of us would readily assent will save many a sentence from coming down with a bump. By using stale metaphors, similes, and idioms, you save much mental effort, at the cost of leaving your meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself. This is the significance of mixed metaphors. The sole aim of a metaphor is to call up a visual image. When these images clash — as in The Fascist octopus has sung its swan song, the jackboot is thrown into the melting pot — it can be taken as certain that the writer is not seeing a mental image of the objects he is naming; in other words he is not really thinking. Look again at the examples I gave at the beginning of this essay. Professor Laski (1) uses five negatives in fifty three words. One of these is superfluous, making nonsense of the whole passage, and in addition there is the slip — alien for akin — making further nonsense, and several avoidable pieces of clumsiness which increase the general vagueness. Professor Hogben (2) plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write prescriptions, and, while disapproving of the everyday phrase put up with, is unwilling to look egregious up in the dictionary and see what it means; (3), if one takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply meaningless: probably one could work out its intended meaning by reading the whole of the article in which it occurs. In (4), the writer knows more or less what he wants to say, but an accumulation of stale phrases chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In (5), words and meaning have almost parted company. People who write in this manner usually have a general emotional meaning — they dislike one thing and want to express solidarity with another — but they are not interested in the detail of what they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. The will construct your sentences for you — even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent — and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear. In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing. Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a ‘party line’. Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White papers and the speeches of undersecretaries do, of course, vary from party to party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, homemade turn of speech. When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder — one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity. In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, ‘I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so’. Probably, therefore, he will say something like this: ‘While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.’ The inflated style itself is a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find — this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years, as a result of dictatorship. But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better. The debased language that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient. Phrases like a not unjustifiable assumption, leaves much to be desired, would serve no good purpose, a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind, are a continuous temptation, a packet of aspirins always at one's elbow. Look back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. By this morning's post I have received a pamphlet dealing with conditions in Germany. The author tells me that he ‘felt impelled’ to write it. I open it at random, and here is almost the first sentence I see: ‘[The Allies] have an opportunity not only of achieving a radical transformation of Germany's social and political structure in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself, but at the same time of laying the foundations of a co-operative and unified Europe.’ You see, he ‘feels impelled’ to write — feels, presumably, that he has something new to say — and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering the bugle, group themselves automatically into the familiar dreary pattern. This invasion of one's mind by ready-made phrases (lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation) can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one's brain. I said earlier that the decadence of our language is probably curable. Those who deny this would argue, if they produced an argument at all, that language merely reflects existing social conditions, and that we cannot influence its development by any direct tinkering with words and constructions. So far as the general tone or spirit of a language goes, this may be true, but it is not true in detail. Silly words and expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process but owing to the conscious action of a minority. Two recent examples were explore every avenue and leave no stone unturned, which were killed by the jeers of a few journalists. There is a long list of flyblown metaphors which could similarly be got rid of if enough people would interest themselves in the job; and it should also be possible to laugh the not un- formation out of existence(3), to reduce the amount of Latin and Greek in the average sentence, to drive out foreign phrases and strayed scientific words, and, in general, to make pretentiousness unfashionable. But all these are minor points. The defence of the English language implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start by saying what it does not imply. To begin with it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the setting up of a ‘standard English’ which must never be departed from. On the contrary, it is especially concerned with the scrapping of every word or idiom which has outworn its usefulness. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax, which are of no importance so long as one makes one's meaning clear, or with the avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is called a ‘good prose style’. On the other hand, it is not concerned with fake simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor does it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin one, though it does imply using the fewest and shortest words that will cover one's meaning. What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can choose — not simply accept — the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impressions one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally. But one can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs rules that one can rely on when instinct fails. I think the following rules will cover most cases: These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English, but one could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in those five specimens at the beginning of this article. I have not here been considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought. Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism? One need not swallow such absurdities as this, but one ought to recognise that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language — and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase — some jackboot, Achilles’ heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno, or other lump of verbal refuse — into the dustbin where it belongs. 1946 _____ 1) An interesting illustration of this is the way in which the English flower names which were in use till very recently are being ousted by Greek ones, snapdragon becoming antirrhinum, forget-me-not becoming myosotis, etc. It is hard to see any practical reason for this change of fashion: it is probably due to an instinctive turning-awayfrom the more homely word and a vague feeling that the Greek word is scientific. [back] 2) Example: ‘Comfort's catholicity of perception and image, strangely Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact opposite in aesthetic compulsion, continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric accumulative hinting at a cruel, an inexorably serene timelessness... Wrey Gardiner scores by aiming at simple bull's-eyes with precision. Only they are not so simple, and through this contented sadness runs more than the surface bitter-sweet of resignation’. (Poetry Quarterly.) [back] 3) One can cure oneself of the not un- formation by memorizing this sentence: A not unblack dog was chasing a not unsmall rabbit across a not ungreen field.

https://time.com/6588328/trump-appeal-alabama-history/,"The results in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have made it clear that the GOP presidential primary probably will be a coronation for former President Donald Trump. Trump beat his closest rival Nikki Haley by double digits in New Hampshire on Tuesday, despite the state being favorable to her. But while the political world turns its attention to South Carolina, which hosts the next primary, those who want to understand Trump’s dominance should look to where his challengers held their December debate: Tuscaloosa, Ala. Red states like Alabama rarely receive national political attention because they’re largely non-competitive. A Democrat hasn’t won the state at the presidential level since Jimmy Carter in 1976, and Democrats have won only one Senate race there since 1992, Doug Jones’ special election victory in 2017 under extraordinary circumstances. But Alabama wasn’t always as predictable. As late as 1984, President Ronald Reagan campaigned in Tuscaloosa. Reagan’s trip provides an indication as to why Trump has proved to be unstoppable in the GOP primary. In the 1960s, the reign of racist Governor George C. Wallace painted Alabama as a reactionary state. Yet, the state’s politics were more complex. While all of its politicians defended segregation, iconic New Deal Democrats like Senators Lister Hill and John Sparkman had thrived as economic liberals for decades, as they strove to increase opportunities for Alabamians despite supporting segregation to stay in office. Both were advocates for organized labor and supported federal programs like the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to improve the lives of their less affluent constituents. But things were changing in the 1960s. In 1962, Hill’s re-election to a fifth term in Washington was supposed to be “a coronation."" Instead, “out of nowhere,” came a young veteran named Jim Martin. The upstart challenger had fought for General George Patton during World War II, married a former Miss Alabama, built a fortune from oil distribution, and became, in the words of Alabama political commentator Steve Flowers, “one of the fathers of the modern Republican Party in the South.” While all candidates advocated for segregation, Martin portrayed himself as a moderate, pro-business politician who favored limited government intervention. For example, he later founded the Forever Wild Land Trust through funds from oil drilling. And unlike others on the right, Martin did not want to completely dismantle the New Deal order erected by figures like Hill. He believed in maintaining government control of public lands, for example, and supported the TVA as well. Read More: The Surprising Voters Driving Trump to Victory While Hill had won reelection by 37 points in 1956, Martin gave him a massive scare. The outcome was so close that NBC’s Chet Huntley and David Brinkley reported that Martin had won before the final vote count revealed that the incumbent senator had survived by a 6,000 vote margin. The tight race exposed a state that was losing its decades-long loyalty to the Democratic Party. The transition would become clearer in the years to come as Barry Goldwater captured the state in 1964 and Richard Nixon won it in 1972. (Wallace won the state in 1968 as a third party candidate.) Alabama’s turn to the right and the GOP exemplified a shift in the national political landscape that accelerated in the 1970s. White working-class Democrats swung to the right, because the party had shifted from representing economic opportunity for them to being the party of social liberalism, including anti-war activism, busing (a dog whistle for integration), and what they considered to be general cultural decline. Liberals had not fully understood, and also often ignored, the cultural sensibilities of the white working class. Those voters also now believed that, instead of helping them economically, liberals wanted to increase their taxes to benefit less deserving communities in places they felt they couldn’t relate to. This combination of economics and culture pushed what was once a key piece of the New Deal Democratic coalition toward supporting the GOP. Despite their disillusionment, many of these white working class Democrats voted for Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and evangelical Christian from Plains, Ga. Yet, Carter disappointed them by trying to find a middle ground on contentious culture issues like abortion. Carter was a strong supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and pardoned some Vietnam draft dodgers. Many Americans also associated his presidency with economic woes. That created an opportunity for figures like Alabama religious zealot Jeremiah Denton, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, who was far to the right of Martin, let alone New Dealers like Hill and Sparkman. In 1977, Denton retired from the military and founded the Coalition for Decency to combat what he saw as the moral degeneracy represented by the sexual revolution, drug use, and modern television. Rather than focus on economic policies that would help struggling Alabamians—as Hill and Sparkman did during the New Deal—Denton called for government spending that would advance his moral agenda, appealing to voters’ conservative social values. For example, Denton argued for and won millions in federal funding to encourage abstinence among teenagers. American literary legend Hunter S. Thompson later characterized him as ""a genuine dingbat who [would] seize almost any opportunity to make a fool of himself.” Yet, Denton capitalized on the failures of Carter, and the newly active “moral majority,” a grassroots movement launched by Rev. Jerry Falwell in 1979 to crusade for conservative Christian values. Denton ran for the Senate in 1980 and won narrowly, becoming the first Republican senator from Alabama since Reconstruction. The majority of his platform centered around the preservation of the nuclear family and increased military intervention abroad, with the economy deemphasized. His victory illustrated how much the electorate had shifted rightward since Martin put the GOP on the map in Alabama in 1962. Even so, Alabama still wasn’t a sure thing for Republicans when Ronald Reagan launched his campaign for reelection. In 1980, the president had only won the state by 1.3%, while Denton won by a little over 3%. Leaving nothing to chance, Reagan arrived in Tuscaloosa on Oct. 15, 1984 with Denton by his side. He wanted to use the appearance to appeal to young voters and Southerners. The president’s speech largely steered away from policy. Instead, the former actor used slogans, one-liners, and cultural references to entertain the crowd. When asked why he came to speak at the university, he responded, “They told me I was invited.” He called Alabama football coach Bear Bryant a “patriotic” American and claimed his “economic policy” was “Roll Tide Roll.” Read More: Mo Brooks' Loss Shows Trump's Grip Remains Strong, at Least in Alabama After the speech, Reagan stopped at a Northport McDonald’s to eat a hamburger with locals. In a move to show relatability and create a story for the media, the president allegedly took $20 from his Secret Service detail and asked them what to order. He sat between two men and ate a hamburger, while shaking hands with everyone who interrupted him. He then signed a child’s cast and took the fries to go. For white working class Alabamans, who felt alienated by Democrats, Reagan’s visit to the fast food restaurant sent a message that he could relate to them and understood their lives and values. The McDonald's visit was so meaningful to locals that after the building was demolished, the owner placed a bust of Reagan in the new restaurant. Over the next two decades, Alabama became a rock-ribbed Republican state—one that epitomized the new socially conservative GOP that favored government intervention on moral issues, while opposing social programs and favoring low taxes. To the working class white voters who shifted parties, opposition to taxes and social programs protected their hard earned dollars and did not support programs that offended them. But while Republicans won every presidential election in the state between 1984 and 2012, none of the candidates captured Alabama quite like Donald Trump did in 2016. It was not a coincidence that Trump picked up his second major endorsement in Feb., 2016 from then-Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions at a rally in front of 32,000 people in Madison, Alabama. Surrounded by booths selling his merchandise and fans who were wearing it, Trump had won over the crowd before he set foot on stage. What made Trump so popular in Ala. was his ability to combine the cultural politics wielded by Denton and the showmanship of Reagan.  When a plane flew overhead, Trump shouted, “What is that? Oh. Uh oh, it’s ISIS, get them down!” It’s this combination that has made Trump an almost cult-like figure with Republican base voters—and why he has won the first two primaries, despite facing 91 indictments in four criminal cases. His open disdain for the usual rules of politics has only made him more popular with his base, tapping into and providing an outlet for the frustration among working class white voters that dates back more than a half century. The political changes in Alabama that began in the 1960s and fueled the rise of politicians like Jeremiah Denton ushered in a new breed of Republicanism, one that Trump has played into with almost unparalleled success, and which will likely win him the GOP nomination and maybe even the presidency.

https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-pulled-a-hashtag-tracking-feature-researchers-used-to-study-the-platform-015454077.html,"TikTok recently pulled a tool that allowed researchers and others to study the popularity of hashtags on its app. The change, first reported by The New York Times, came shortly after researchers published a report using data from the tool that criticized the company. As The New York Times points out, the tool was one of the few publicly-accessible methods of tracking details about the popularity of specific hashtags. TikTok, like other social media companies, has made it difficult for outsiders to track how content spreads in its app. The tool in question is a feature called Creative Center, which provides data about the popularity of hashtags to would-be advertisers and others. Researchers at Rutgers’ Network Contagion Institute had used Creative Center’s search function to track hashtags deemed “sensitive” to Chinese government interests. The researchers compared the prevalence of the hashtags between TikTok and Instagram and concluded that many ""sensitive"" topics were ""dramatically underrepresented on TikTok"" compared with Instagram. Soon after the report was published, the researchers said the search feature in Creative Center disappeared without an explanation. “Search capacity for Hashtags has itself now been removed from the user interface entirely, which NCRI discovered to have occurred on Christmas day, days after this report’s initial release,” they wrote in an addendum to the report. They added that TikTok had also disabled direct access to a number of “sensitive” topics they had previously tracked, including hashtags related to US politics and other geopolitical issues. In a statement to The New York Times, TikTok confirmed the change. “Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations have misused the Center’s search function to draw inaccurate conclusions, so we are changing some of the features to ensure it is used for its intended purpose,” a company spokesperson said. The dust-up is the latest example of mounting tensions between social media companies and researchers trying to study thorny topics like misinformation. Meta has also found itself at odds with researchers, and reportedly plans to deprecate CrowdTangle, a tool widely used by researchers and journalists to study how content spreads on Facebook. X has also greatly restricted researchers’ access to data since Elon Musk took control of the company, making its once open APIs prohibitively expensive to most groups. In TikTok’s case, the company may be particularly sensitive to what it considers improper use of its tools. The company has for years denied that it aligns its content policies with the interests of the Chinese government as numerous government officials have called for the app to be banned. More recently, the company faced increased scrutiny over its handling of content related to the Israel-Hamas war — criticism that was also fueled by what the company said was an inaccurate portrayal of hashtag data. That said, the company has made some concessions to researchers. TikTok began offering an official Research API to some academic institutions last year, and reportedly plans to make the tools available to some civil society groups that have questioned the company’s content moderation practices. But for researchers, the move to abruptly cut off a tool will likely fuel more questions about just how willing the company is to work with them. “This lack of transparency is of deep concern to researchers,” the NCRI researchers wrote.

https://time.com/6553798/south-korea-lee-jae-myung-stabbed-attacker-politics/,"Eight days after a harrowing stabbing of South Korea’s firebrand opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, the politician emerged from a Seoul hospital on Wednesday to greet the media and supporters with stirring resolve in his first public comments since the incident. The 59-year-old chairman of the Democratic Party of Korea, who at one point was in intensive care, underwent surgery to mend a major blood vessel in his neck after the attack in the southern port city of Busan. “I truly hope that this incident, which surprised all of us, will serve as a landmark in ending politics of hatred and confrontation and restoring decent politics in which we respect each other and co-exist,” Lee said. “We should put an end to warlike politics where we have to kill and eliminate opponents.” The same day, police announced the findings of their investigation into Lee’s assailant, a man in his 60s who had lunged at Lee while pretending to ask for an autograph. The suspect, identified only by his family name Kim, had committed the attack “out of subjective political beliefs,” Woo Chul-moon, head of the Busan Metropolitan Police Agency, said on Wednesday. He added that Kim told the police he wanted to kill Lee to “prevent him from becoming president” and “taking a majority of seats in the upcoming general elections.” Lee narrowly lost to President Yoon Suk Yeol, of the conservative People Power Party, in the country’s 2022 presidential election. National Assembly elections are scheduled for April this year. Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: Half of World Heads to Polls in 2024 Kim, who was escorted into a vehicle outside a Busan police station on Wednesday, told reporters that he was “sorry” for causing concerns. The police have chosen not to disclose Kim’s full name, photo, or political party affiliation, citing legal reasons. While authorities had earlier detained another man in his 70s on suspicion of abetting Kim in the attack, the police concluded on Wednesday that Kim had acted alone without an accomplice. South Korea’s national police agency has pledged to prevent similar incidents by strengthening security for “key personnel.” The attack sent shockwaves through the nation and drew condemnation from figures across the political spectrum. Yoon’s office said in a statement that the act was “an enemy of liberal democracy” and wished Lee a speedy recovery. Yoon also ordered authorities to investigate the attack and support Lee’s medical treatment. Hong Ik Pyo from the Democratic Party—led by Lee—similarly said at a party meeting that the “act of terror” against Lee was “clearly a challenge against democracy.” However, despite the shared condemnation of the recent attack on Lee, divisions between the major political parties have continued to exacerbate in recent years. In a survey published last March by the Korea Institute of Public Administration, 93% of respondents cited the divide between conservatives and progressives as the most serious conflict faced by the country. Meanwhile, Yoon has been accused of fanning the flames of such polarization to shore up political support. Since his election defeat in 2022, Lee has been undergoing a series of investigations for charges that include bribery and breach of trust—allegations that he has denounced as politically motivated and even protested in a 24-day hunger strike last year. Lee’s trials, which have been delayed, were also cited as one of the motivations for Kim’s attack, police said, as Kim had felt that the politician was not being properly punished for the criminal charges. Despite the political wrangling and near-fatal attack, Lee appears undeterred in his electoral goals. On Wednesday, as Lee thanked the police and medical workers who treated him, he pledged to continue serving the public. “With this life that has been saved by the people,” he said, “I will live the rest of my life only for the people.” Contact us at letters@time.com",politics,relevant,"The article discusses the recent stabbing of South Korea’s opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and his subsequent emergence from the hospital with a message of unity and decency in politics.

Kennedy cavorts with celebrities and Silicon Valley billionaires, and his aggressive approach to content creators has targeted influencers both big and small to reach important electoral demographics. “He is the podcast candidate,” says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories. “Vivek Ramaswamy was someone in the GOP who had some of that, but RFK Jr. is the podcast, Substack, terminally online candidate.” In short, the internet has become Kennedy’s campaign headquarters, where likes and shares have replaced the retail politics of more traditional opponents like President Joe Biden. And Kennedy’s digital determination may well make a big difference: According to some experts, he could disrupt the 2024 election. While the election field has seemingly narrowed to yet another duel between Biden and former president Donald Trump, Kennedy’s conspiracy-focused populist pitch and powerful family name have tapped a rich vein of influence across both Hollywood and the internet, building a vast network of aggrieved supporters prepared to back him through election day. Last April, Kennedy announced his campaign in a nearly two-hour-long speech condemning the mainstream media, the government, and numerous other institutions like the pharmaceutical industry. “This is what happens when you censor somebody for 18 years,” he said. “I got a lot to talk about.” Though Kennedy originally built a career as a top environmental lawyer who played an outsize role in cleaning New York’s Hudson River, he has spent years stoking fear over unfounded claims that vaccines may cause autism in children. By 2020, this skepticism started to include the Covid-19 pandemic. In a roundtable conversation after announcing his campaign, Kennedy falsely claimed that vaccines caused the 1918 flu. Weeks before Covid vaccines became available widely in the US, Facebook (now Meta) suspended Kennedy’s Instagram for sharing debunked claims related to the virus and vaccines. In June, Kennedy sat for a three-hour interview with Joe Rogan on his podcast. The pair discussed Kennedy’s personal history at length, as well as his longtime vaccine skepticism and the debunked conspiracy theory that Wi-Fi and 5G could cause cancer, autism, and what Kennedy called “leaky brain.” Elliot Ackerman Will Knight Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica David Gilbert “I think it degrades your mitochondria, and it opens your blood-brain barrier,” he said. After the podcast was published, Spotify received criticism from vaccine scientists like Peter Hotez and from numerous news outlets for hosting Rogan in the first place. His dangerous vaccine conspiracies were a precursor to other claims about the state of media coverage. Speaking in West Virginia in January, Kennedy bemoaned how his campaign was doing poorly at reaching baby boomers. “They only get their news from ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and The New York Times,” Kennedy said. “If you’re young and you have parents, you need to lock them up and make them listen to a Joe Rogan podcast.” Kennedy’s digital assault is his only chance at name recognition, let alone the presidency. He’s embraced by people on both the far left and far right, opening up media opportunities across the online political spectrum. Being shut out from the mainstream media, he has become a digital martyr, earning him the sympathies of the aggrieved and “censored” political class who welcome him on their shows and platforms. Kennedy isn’t the first presidential candidate to experiment with more alternative social mediums: Ahead of the 2020 Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang also sat for interviews with Rogan. After Sanders’ August 2019 appearance, Jeff Weaver, then a senior adviser to the campaign, told reporters that the show was an opportunity “to reach a broader audience” and that Sanders was “much more comfortable in formats that allow a more free flow and longform answers.” The Kennedy name is one of the most familiar in American political history, and he has leveraged it to provide legitimacy to both his campaign and the antiestablishment message he pushes online. “The Kennedy name was almost turned into something else,” says Rothschild. “It’s like he’s got that sort of glow of having been wronged by the deep state.” Kennedy’s proclivity toward disruption has also garnered the attention of some of the most wealthy, and reactionary, tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Shortly after his Rogan appearance, billionaire investor Bill Ackman and venture capitalist David Sacks donated to his campaign. Sacks also moderated a rambling conversation with Kennedy and Elon Musk in a Twitter Space last June where Kennedy spent a majority of the time praising Musk for “rescuing democracy and freedom of speech” by purchasing the platform. Many of these venture capitalists, like Sacks, have sizable online audiences of their own, blasting notifications for their followers to join these live chat shows when they start. Kennedy’s celebrity friends have become financial boons for his campaign as well. Clueless star Alicia Silverstone endorsed Kennedy right out of the gate last summer, writing on Instagram that he gives her “hope.” In September, Eric Clapton, musician and anti-vaxxer himself, played a Los Angeles fundraiser for Kennedy that raised $1 million for his campaign and another $1.2 million for the pro-Kennedy American Values 2024 super PAC. In January at Kennedy’s 70th birthday gala in West Hollywood, comedian Theo Von and Kennedy’s wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines spoke—and the PAC raised $5.8 million. On Wednesday, Kennedy’s campaign advertised an online auction on Instagram, accepting bids for “virtual coffee” meetings with Hines and tickets to a pro-Kennedy comedy show for later this month featuring Tim Dillon, Rob Schneider, and Bobby Lee priced at $150, $1,000, and $1,500. At least one of Kennedy’s campaign trail outfits was styled by Tom Soluri, a professional costumer who also worked on a Golden Bachelor promotional campaign. Elliot Ackerman Will Knight Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica David Gilbert But none of these celebrity endorsements and events would matter if they weren’t expertly photographed and packaged for social media pushes. In campaign emails to supporters, the Kennedy campaign asks for “likes, comments, and shares” on these Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube videos for “maximum exposure,” on top of encouraging supporters to donate to his campaign. Last week, the Kennedy team sent out an email blast asking for engagement on a YouTube Short asking for donations. The support Kennedy has received from mega-famous celebrities and billionaires has become one of the campaign’s most powerful marketing strategies, but it’s not the only way they’ve worked to reach voters: The American Values 2024 PAC has started blasting the candidate’s message through networks of influencers with far smaller followings than Rogan or Clapton. According to Federal Election Commission filings, last month the super PAC paid Creator and Company, a content creation and influencer management company, around $150,000 for video production and advertising. Around the same time these payments were made, the PAC launched a social media challenge called #AmericaMoves24, encouraging people to post videos showing how they fit 24 minutes of exercise into their daily lives. Some posts, like from fitness creator Margaux Celeste Alvarez, tag Kennedy and the PAC’s accounts. “I love the #AmericaMoves challenge that @robertfkennedyjr, Kennedy Wellness & @americanvalues 2024 is spearheading: to be active and move for 24 minutes a day,” Alvarez wrote on Instagram last week. “You can get it however you want.” On Monday, American Values 2024 confirmed that the $150,000 payment was related to the #AmericaMoves challenge, telling WIRED that the goal of the social media campaign was “to appeal to younger voters and fitness enthusiasts.” Another post, from fitness influencer Chandler Junk, doesn’t directly mention the campaign or super PAC at all. Junk’s video encourages his audience to go to the PAC’s website to sign up for “a chance to win a custom home gym valued up to $25,000.” The prize offering appears to be an attempt at gathering the names and emails of fitness hobbyists. “We’ve seen similar usage of influencers by political candidates that have a relationship to either the celebrity world or the business world,” says Samuel Woolley, the director of propaganda research at the University of Texas at Austin’s Center for Media Engagement. “It’s a way of getting a candidate’s name out there and building rapport through a means other than politics and divisive issues like abortion or for Kennedy, vaccination.” While some creators participating in the America Moves challenge have followings around 1 million in size, others have much smaller audiences of under 10,000 followers. Since the 2020 presidential election, campaigns and political groups have begun investing in content collaborations with nano and micro influencers to target more niche demographics in hotbed states like Arizona and Georgia. In 2022, the Democratic super PAC American Bridge spent hundreds of thousands on an influencer campaign to support Democrats in the midterm elections. “The reason why campaigns use these micro and nano influencers a lot of the time is because those people are seen to have more authentic relationships with particular demographics,” Woolley told WIRED. “The influencers are seen as a natural conduit to those spaces.” Elliot Ackerman Will Knight Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica David Gilbert It can be difficult to parse how much money a campaign or political groups spend on influencer marketing because these payments are often obscured with opaque language like “digital consulting” in FEC records. In 2020, the Trump campaign spent more than $1 million for “online advertising” to an influencer marketing company owned by a former Trump administration adviser. Just last month, the pro-Biden super PAC Priorities USA spent around $1 million for its own influencer campaign. But for Kennedy, he’s already able to reach huge audiences through his podcast interviews and posts with celebrities that other campaigns may try to buy. And Kennedy has nailed the celebrity-to-influencer to internet pipeline: His social outputs don’t even appear to be advertising merely his campaign, but him as a person. Last year, American Values appeared to make its first attempt at reaching hyper-targeted demographics online. According to FEC records, the PAC spent around $1,500 in November to the music news site, AllHipHop, for “social media” dissemination. The filing shows that the media obligation was to take place on October 25. That same day, the AllHipHop Instagram account shared a video of Beanie Sigel, one of the first rappers signed to Jay-Z’s Roc-a-Fella records, endorsing Kennedy’s campaign. The post does not disclose whether it was paid by the super PAC. AllHipHop did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED, but the PAC said that it did not pay for Sigel’s endorsement and “only paid to boost” it on AllHipHop’s Instagram account. Many of Kennedy’s non-celeb supporters have also become megaphones for the campaign’s content themselves. Last summer, members of the r/RFKJrForPresident subreddit launched a Discord server to distribute “content that the mainstream media is ignoring about Bobby Kennedy,” writing in a post that “a search for positive Kennedy content returns no results.” As of publication, the Independents for Kennedy server has just under 800 users, hosting channels that post every piece of content the Kennedy publishes on all of his social media platforms under a section called “Content for Distribution.” As an Independent candidate, Kennedy doesn’t need to defeat either Biden or Trump in a primary race, but he faces an even steeper uphill battle to get on the general election ballots. The requirements for Independent candidates to gain ballot access varies across states, making it difficult for anyone outside of the Democratic and Republican parties to run a promising general election campaign. Kennedy’s team is reportedly struggling to find all the signatures necessary to get on state ballots and has considered launching its own “We the People” party or linking arms with the Libertarian party to prop up his chances. At the top of the Kennedy campaign website is a banner calling for volunteers to gather all of the signatures it needs to gain ballot access in every state across the country. Time will tell whether its vast online support network is willing to knock on doors to meet these requirements and push Kennedy through to election day. But getting Kennedy on the ballot in just a few states, especially battleground states like Pennsylvania, could still cause a problem for both Biden and Trump even if he doesn’t have a clear path to victory in November. Elliot Ackerman Will Knight Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica David Gilbert “I do think he has a smart strategy, because he’s really trying very hard to get on ballots in what are perceived swing states, and that’s important,” says Melissa M. Smith, an author and communications and journalism professor at Mississippi University for Women. “If he can be, for instance, on the ballot in Georgia or on the ballot in Arizona, and he could pull enough votes, then he might potentially make a difference in those individual states … If you can be on those ballots, then you can potentially be a lot more disruptive.” Recent polls have shown that neither Biden nor Trump are exciting choices for voters, and some experts have suggested that even a few thousand disenchanted Kennedy voters could sway the election in either direction. Republican opponents, like Ron DeSantis, tried to peel off Trump supporters by criticizing the former president’s pandemic-era lockdowns. Since DeSantis has dropped out of the race, Kennedy could rope those voters into his base. “If 10,000 disillusioned Republicans vote for RFK because they’ve listened to so much InfoWars that they think the vaccine is going to kill them in a year, that could be enough for Biden to pick off a couple of states,” Rothschild said. “I think that is very much in play right now.” Other experts, like Matt Bennett, executive vice president of public affairs at the center-left think tank Third Way, say that Biden has just as much to fear of Kennedy as Trump. “If he stays in this to the end, even if he’s on the ballot in 50 states, which is unlikely, this will distill down to a smaller percentage of voters, and we don’t know who they are,” Bennett said. “They might be young men who follow fitness influencers and maybe that hurts Trump. It’s not clear. Or they might be low-information Democrats who see the name Kennedy and think, ‘Well, that’s good. That’s a safe pair of hands if we don’t want Biden.’” Still, Kennedy likely won’t win in November. This momentum could grind to a halt in the weeks and months to come. But the internet has allowed him to build an entire campaign, pushing his message out from the darker parts of the web and into the social media feeds of average users, and that’s no small feat. 📧 Find the best bargains on quality gear with our Deals newsletter Two nations, a horrible accident, and the urgent need to understand the laws of space Black Twitter remains unbothered in Elon Musk’s X A group of trolling Gen-Z voters is buying up GOP domains The murky campaign to discredit lab-grown meat How to organize your tech and purge that random box of cables 🌞 See if you take a shine to our picks for the best sunglasses and sun protection Matt Burgess Megan Farokhmanesh David Gilbert Simon Hill Jason Parham Angela Watercutter Rhett Allain Reece Rogers More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

https://www.businessinsider.com/kari-lake-jeff-dewit-bribery-recording-arizona-republican-party-2024-1,"       The chairman of the Arizona Republican Party resigned on Wednesday, alleging the GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake all but forced him into doing so. On Tuesday, the Daily Mail published a 10-minute audio recording in which Jeff DeWit, the party chairman who's served for just under a year, appears to bribe Lake into staying out of politics for two years. ""Soo the ask I got today from back East was, 'Is there any companies out there or something that could just put her on the payroll to keep her out?'"" DeWit says, according to the audio. ""You can take a pause for a couple of years. You can go right back to what you're doing."" Lake, apparently recording the in-person interaction herself, can be heard repeatedly rejecting the entreaties, saying she wouldn't even do it for $1 billion. The recording purportedly took place in March 2023, before Lake had announced her campaign for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Lake later told NBC News in Hampshire — where she was attending the election night party for former President Donald Trump — that DeWit should resign. ""He's got to resign,"" said Lake. ""We can't have someone who is corrupt and compromised running the Republican Party.""

DeWit also said the recording ""confirms a disturbing tendency to exploit private interactions for personal gain"" and that it raised questions over whether she could be ""trusted to engage in private and confidential conversations"" as a senator. And he claimed that Lake had threatened to release even more damaging audio. ""I received an ultimatum from Lake's team: resign today or face the release of a new, more damaging recording,"" said DeWit. ""I am truly unsure of its contents, but considering our numerous past open conversations as friends, I have decided not to take the risk."" FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Statement from Chairman @JeffDeWitAZ  #AZGOP pic.twitter.com/qxKd2Pqlp6 It is not immediately clear who will succeed DeWit as chair. In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesman for the Lake campaign denied DeWit's account, saying that ""no one from the Kari Lake campaign threatened or blackmailed DeWit."" ""The tape speaks for itself,"" the spokesman said. ""DeWit's false claims are just par for the course. The Arizona GOP must be relieved to have his resignation. Now we can focus on getting ethical leadership and win big in 2024."" Despite losing the 2022 gubernatorial campaign to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs — and continuing to contest the results of that election — Lake is all but certain to be the party's nominee for Senate in 2024, where she will face Democratic Rep.

https://www.businessinsider.com/nikki-haley-trump-south-carolina-gop-primary-history-2024-2024-1,"       American politics can get nasty. Few places have shown a history of showcasing dirty tricks like South Carolina, the state that could once again have the final word in a presidential race. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley has made it clear that she will make her potential last stand there, in her home state. Haley said on Tuesday night that she would remain in the race after losing by double-digits to Trump but still hanging tough. She's effectively already ceded Nevada to the former president, meaning that South Carolina's February 24 primary will be the next contest to feature a clash between the top two candidates. If history holds, this race could get even meaner. Already, Haley and Trump have thrown barbs at each other, though the score sheet is hardly even. She has questioned Trump's basic competency, pointing to recent flubs, such as when he confused her with Nancy Pelosi. Trump has rehashed his racist lie about Barack Obama into questioning whether Haley is truly an American. (To be clear, just like Obama, she is.) ""We are going to destroy her in South Carolina,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and noted Trump ally, said as the results were being released in New Hampshire. ""It's going to be a complete humiliation."" It was in South Carolina that then-Sen. John McCain in 2000 was confronted with a racist ""push poll"" that asked voters about a potential illegitimate Black child. In reality, he had adopted a child. Then-Texas Gov. George Bush, whose campaign advisors have long denied responsibility, went on to blow McCain out, effectively sealing the nomination. Almost eight years later, someone sent South Carolina Republicans fake Christmas cards purporting to be from then-former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and his family that featured controversial passages from the Book of Mormon. Romney, who was already struggling in the state, didn't come close to winning. Haley herself has seen the Palmetto State's ugly side. In her 2010 gubernatorial campaign, she faced allegations of infidelity, which she strongly denied, that may have backfired as she won the primary and coasted through the general election. To be fair, Some have argued it's mostly an exaggeration to cast the state as the bare-knuckled brother of the early states. It's not like Trump needs the calendar to tell him to go low either. This is after all the same man who bizarrely accused Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's father of being connected to JFK's assassination and called Cruz's wife, Heidi, ugly. Before the 2024 primary even started, Trump went so far as to suggest that DeSantis, just out of college, inappropriately partied with high schoolers when he was a teacher. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush deployed most of his family in the state ahead of the 2016 primary, but not even former President George W. Bush could save his brother. Unlike Bush, Haley is a former governor of the state. She'll still have to confront the reality that her successor, Gov. Henry McMaster, has endorsed Trump. Most of the state's congressional delegation is also against her. Sen. Tim Scott, whose political career Haley helped, is even rumored as a possible Trump running mate. And for every Tom Harkin, who blitzed through the 1992 Iowa caucuses, other homegrown candidates have been handed humbling lessons by their own voters, most recently Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2020 and Marco Rubio in 2016. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has long been a Trump ally, dropped out at the last minute in 2016 just before polls showed he would have lost in South Carolina. Of the early states, South Carolina offers by far the largest delegate prize. If Haley is truly insistent on competing with Trump for the long haul, doing well in her home state will be vital in the long-term play for the delegates that will decide the nomination. South Carolina has a hybrid winner-take-all model for its 50 delegates based on performances in each of the state's seven congressional districts as well as the overall winner. In short, it means that a second-place finish, even if it's kept pretty close, would still be disastrous. Read next Jump to",politics,relevant,"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley is planning to make her last stand in the South Carolina primary, after losing to Trump in other states. The political climate in South Carolina is known for dirty tricks and nasty tactics, with past examples including racist push polls and fake Christmas cards. Haley has faced similar attacks in the past, but is determined to compete with Trump in her home state. Despite facing opposition from Trump allies in the state, Haley is focused on doing well in South Carolina to secure vital delegates for the nomination."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68065395,"Australia's former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced he will quit parliament to join the private sector. Mr Morrison, a conservative who was first elected in 2007, was the country's leader from 2018 to 2022. He oversaw Australia's pandemic response, the Aukus defence pact, and was embroiled in a historic scandal for secretly appointing himself to several ministerial positions while PM. ""The time has come for me to return to private life,"" he said on Tuesday. In a statement Mr Morrison, 55, said he would now take on ""strategic advisory roles"" across Asia to focus on security matters in the Indo-Pacific. A devout Christian, he said he was ""looking forward to being more active"" in his church and spending time with his family. Mr Morrison's retirement has long been expected following a shattering election loss to Labor's Anthony Albanese in 2022, which left the Liberal-National coalition with its lowest ever number of seats. Australia's reputation as a climate laggard was a major factor in his government's demise - with voters favouring candidates committed to more ambitious emissions cuts. Mr Morrison's initial response to Covid - which included border closures, lockdowns and test and trace protocols - is credited with helping to contain early outbreaks, although a delayed vaccine rollout later drew criticism. During his time in office, the prime minister had a particularly rocky relationship with China, Australia's largest trading partner. His government led calls for an international investigation into the origins of Covid, prompting a tit-for-tat trade dispute and a years-long diplomatic freeze. In a strategic pivot, Mr Morrison instead focused on bolstering regional security alliances, helping to set up the Quad partnership with India, Japan and the US, and signing the Aukus nuclear submarine deal with the UK and US. But public support for him had begun deteriorating rapidly following his decision to holiday in Hawaii during Australia's deadly 2019-2020 bushfires. Later, he apologised after being widely criticised for his initial muted response to a string of sexual misconduct allegations which rocked parliament. After his 2022 election defeat - described by an internal review as the ""most serious"" loss in coalition history - Mr Morrison returned to the opposition backbench. He became the first former prime minister to be censured by parliament - over secret powers he had given himself during the pandemic. Mr Morrison said his decision to make himself the joint minister for health, finance, treasury, and home affairs while leader had been in keeping with the ""extraordinary times"" the country was facing. Ultimately, an investigation found his appointments were legal, and that he used his extra powers only once. Mr Morrison first garnered national attention in 2013 when he was appointed to cabinet as immigration minister and oversaw Operation Sovereign Borders - which hardened Australia's controversial asylum seeker policies. He then served as social services minister and treasurer, before succeeding Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal Party leader and prime minister. Mr Morrison famously defied polls to win the 2019 federal election, having pitched himself to voters as an everyday family man the nation could trust, and adopting the nickname ""ScoMo"". After a decade of political leadership challenges in both major parties which upended governments, he became the first prime minister to serve a full term since John Howard in 2007.

https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/01/green-day-saviors-interview/677243/?utm_source=feed,"Green Day is still attracting controversy, and listeners, with its blend of politics and punk. Listen to this article 00:00 09:44 Produced by ElevenLabs and NOA, News Over Audio, using AI narration. Were anyone in denial that this would be an election year ruled by conflict and nonsense, a wake-up call came in the form of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. Performing on the variety show, the rock band Green Day changed one line from their 2004 song “American Idiot”: “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda” became “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” Thus was born the first culture skirmish of 2024. Social media lit up with salutes from the left and complaints from the right. Elon Musk tweeted, “Green Day goes from raging against the machine to milquetoastedly raging for it.” Fox News then devoted multiple segments to repeating such sentiments. “I just never thought that I’d see a band that’s supposed to be, you know, against everything, raging for the machine,” one on-air commentator said. “Keep on raging for the machine, fellas!” The dustup was perplexing, and not just because Green Day and Rage Against the Machine are totally different bands. “American Idiot” is a protest track inspired by George W. Bush, and the band’s front man, Billie Joe Armstrong, has been reworking it to refer to Donald Trump in performances since 2016. But this particular pronouncement caught some people off guard. Which makes some sense: After presidential politics and popular culture seemed to fuse into one spectacle under the Trump administration, the Biden years have seen mainstream entertainers—and audiences—tune out of partisan topics a bit. Now here was Green Day, forcing network-TV viewers to confront the tensions of 2016 and 2020 again. As the band sees it, making statements is just part of their job. “I would prefer to not have to deal with politics in life, but I’m an adult, and I know that there are things that can only change with speaking out or lashing out,” Tré Cool, the band’s drummer, told me when I met with the group last week. Armstrong seemed particularly baffled by the blowback. “Someone was pearl-clutching on Fox News, and they were like, Why can’t you just shut up and sing?” he said. “And I’m like, Well, I did sing!” When I mentioned that the Fox commentator Greg Gutfeld had argued that the true punks these days were folks such as Musk and the conspiracist-friendly podcaster Joe Rogan, not Green Day, Armstrong let out an unhappy laugh. “It seems backwards to me,” he said. “Elon Musk owns Twitter and he just pushes his agenda to make money … That sounds like a puppet master more than it does a punk. And then, I mean, I don’t listen to Joe Rogan. To me, Joe Rogan just seems like a jock.” The kerfuffle is a sign of why this trio remains one of the most important rock acts of the past three decades. Green Day emerged from an insular California punk scene in the early 1990s with jams so energetic and catchy that even Middle America couldn’t resist. The band was led by a Bay Area bisexual who, as one 2000 hit put it, wanted “to be the minority,” but most of their songs were about topics the majority could relate to: sitting around, watching TV, feeling bored and alienated. Boredom and alienation, of course, are part of our national dysfunction: People tend to go down extremist rabbit holes when they find more fulfillment in their screens than in the real world. This year will offer a few reminders that Green Day has, in a way, been charting our festering national burnout for decades. Dookie, the band’s scrappy breakout release, is turning 30. American Idiot, their political epic, will be 20. This past Friday saw the release of the group’s new album, Saviors, a tight, upbeat collection of songs about the chaos of the 2020s. Considered together, these albums make clear which machines Green Day have actually been raging against: the ones that turn our brains into stew. The three members of Green Day are each 51 years old, and they still style themselves as poster-ready rockers. When I met them at a New York City hotel, the bassist Mike Dirnt sported spiky, peroxide-blond hair and a striped blazer. Cool wore a leather-looking jacket and plaid pants. The still-baby-faced Armstrong made the punkest fashion choice of all: He remained hunched in a heavy winter coat, which dwarfed him like a suit of armor, for the duration of our talk. A particular song from Saviors had been in my head that day: “1981,” a Billy Idol–indebted track inspired by the year when MTV made its debut. Back in ’81, the band members were turning 9 years old and growing up in small-town California. MTV was “the most exciting thing” on TV, Dirnt said, unless you could hack your cable box to pick up HBO or the Playboy network. The song is palpably nostalgic for that era—but it’s also about the dawn of the era we’re still in. “Channel surfing,” Armstrong said, has just accelerated into “channel swiping” on one’s phone. He mentioned a recent experience browsing Instagram Reels. With one swipe, he was shown a video about Gaza; the next, he was shown an old lady trying to dance while undergoing a bout of flatulence. The contrast haunted him as a sign of “the weird time that we live in,” Armstrong said. “Whether it’s war or farts, you never know what you’re going to get.” Saviors is all about such modern juxtapositions. The sound is candied and crunchy, recalling punk rock less than the Beatles, the Cars, and Weezer. Though some songs are about addiction or love, many tracks have self-explanatory titles—“Living in the ’20s,” “Strange Days Are Here to Stay”—and keyword-soup lyrics mentioning fentanyl, TikTok, and Uber drivers who show up late. Conspiracy-theory mindsets are repeatedly lampooned. The lyrics hardly add up to a coherent or point of view, but the confusion they summon seems to be connecting with listeners: The lead single, “The American Dream Is Killing Me,” is surely the first Billboard Rock Airplay No. 1 hit to contain the phrase “we’re pedophiles” (for the American dream, to be clear—again, not that that makes a ton of sense). The band learned long ago that topicality and popularity were compatible. On American Idiot, the trio took aim at the with-us-or-against-us nationalism that buoyed the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The album generated some of the most beloved rock hits of the 21st century (“Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” “Wake Me Up When September Ends,” “American Idiot,” “Holiday”), and the band believes that its messages ended a “period of silence,” as Cool put it. In the early days of the Bush administration, scattered musicians had issued protest songs. But after the country-pop group the Chicks were blacklisted from many radio stations for criticizing the president in 2003, “people were really afraid to say anything” critical of America during wartime, Cool said. “We came out with this record, and I think it was like a breath of fresh air for a lot of artists.” Saviors isn’t as pointedly polemical—or musically ambitious—as Idiot, but it is definitely about American idiocy. The zippy “Look Ma, No Brains!” opens with the lines “Don’t know much about history / ‘Cause I never learned how to read” and just gets more proudly knuckleheaded from there. The song is in part about how in the social-media era, “everybody’s doing stupid shit to get 15 seconds of fame,” Dirnt said, “and sometimes it’s really fucking funny.” Armstrong, a high-school dropout, is also singing about his own insecurities on their goofier tracks. “There’s a vulnerability” to his many songs over the years about feeling like a fool or loser, he said. Our political divides, he added, stem in part from “people that never grew out of high school,” fixating on the same resentments that pit jocks against oddballs. In an economy where so many people are stymied from living the life they always dreamed for themselves, “there’s something about elitism that people get pissed off about,” Armstrong said. At small show at Irving Plaza in Manhattan on the night before Savior’s release, Armstrong made a brief reference to the band’s recent headlines—“the last thing we need is for fuckin’ Elon Musk to be bitchin’ about anything,” he said, after asking people to put away their cellphones. But the tone of the show was less bitter protest than victory lap; the band was playing a shorter version of the set list they’ll bring on tour later this year when they plan to perform Dookie and American Idiot in their entirety. The Saviors lyrics about ennui and apocalypse fit well alongside the older material they played, including the slacker confession of Dookie’s “Longview” and the turn-off-your-brain-and-cheer-for-facism satire of American Idiot’s “Holiday.” Amid all the verses about malaise and anxiety, the music’s galloping, enlivening quality made its own statement.",politics,relevant,"Green Day continues to attract controversy and listeners with its blend of politics and punk. The band recently sparked a culture skirmish by changing lyrics in their song ""American Idiot"" to reference the MAGA agenda, leading to social media debates and Fox News segments. Despite confusion over the band's political stance, Green Day sees making statements as part of their job. The band's new album, ""Saviors,"" addresses the chaos of the 2020s and modern juxtapositions, connecting with listeners through candied and crunchy sound. Green Day's past albums have tackled political and social issues, breaking a period of silence in the music industry. The band's music continues to resonate with audiences, addressing themes of American idiocy, vulnerability, and political divides. Green Day's recent show in Manhattan showcased a mix of new and old material, promising a tour later in the year featuring performances of their iconic albums ""Dookie"" and ""American Idiot."" The band's music, with its galloping and enlivening quality, continues to make a statement in the world of rock music."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68136992,"The deaths of three American soldiers - two women and a man from the US state of Georgia - in a drone attack in Jordan on Sunday was exactly what the Biden administration was dreading. And it means the White House is taking an extremely difficult decision over how to respond. President Biden, who met his national security team in the Situation Room on Monday, says he has decided what to do after currently weighing the options before him. He could choose to strike Iran-allied targets in the region, hit Iran itself, or do nothing at all. All options come with serious risk, especially in an election year where the president has to balance looking strong with ensuring an already dangerous situation does not spin out of control. ""We don't want a wider war with Iran,"" National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told reporters. ""We don't want a wider war in the region, but we've got to do what we have to do."" The Biden administration also has to consider its response to Iran in the context of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Since 7 October, the US's main priority has been to stop the conflict in Gaza from spreading in the region. That's what governed the carefully calibrated American responses to the previous non-fatal attacks on its forces in region. This deadly attack completely changes the equation - the US now feels like it has no choice but to respond forcefully. Yet the need to strike a delicate balance remains. So President Biden needs to find a course of action that sends a much more robust message of deterrence, without causing the very escalation they've been working so hard to avoid. Mr Biden's political rivals - by virtue of being out of power - face no such dilemma. Donald Trump, the clear frontrunner in the race to pick a Republican presidential candidate, set the tone with a Sunday night post on social media that laid the blame squarely on the president. ""This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden's weakness and surrender,"" Mr Trump wrote. The former president did not say, however, how he would respond if he was in office and he has not commented further. Other Republicans have not held back. Senator Tom Cotton said ""the only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation"". Anything less, he added, would confirm the president was a ""coward"". The leading Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called for ""serious, crippling cost to Iran"". Senator Lindsay Graham said the US should ""strike targets of significance inside Iran"". But leading Democrats did not go as far - most called for those responsible to be held accountable and for the US to target Iran-backed groups rather than the country itself. ""This attack… cannot go unanswered,"" Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. ""I support President Biden in a deliberate and proportionate response."" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal used similar language, writing on X that ""a strong, surgical response is vital against Iran-backed forces"". The Biden administration has said its decision on how to respond will not be based on polls or the looming election. ""He's not looking at political calculations,"" John Kirby told reporters. But in an election year, any foreign policy decision is inevitably influenced by domestic politics. How will military action - or inaction - be perceived by American voters? It is often assumed that foreign policy plays a minor part on the decisions voters make about who they want as their president. But with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, polls suggest it is important for more voters this year. The details of this particular attack may well have faded by November when Americans go to the polls - but people do care about the image they think their nation projects in the world. I've heard voters across America tell me they are concerned that the US looks weak these days. They like Donald Trump's promise of strong-man-leadership that will mean no other country would dare to try push America around. Obviously it is much easier to talk about military strategy and global diplomacy on the campaign trail than it is inside the White House situation room. Joe Biden, meanwhile, is faced with a delicate and dangerous decision that could have far-reaching consequences in the Middle East. But his response could also have repercussions closer to home in what is a high-stakes election year. What is Tower 22 and why are US troops in Jordan?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68161541,"Hans-Georg Maassen was once in charge of hunting down neo-Nazis in Germany. Now he is being investigated for suspected right-wing extremism by the intelligence agency he headed until 2018. Mr Maassen has published a letter from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) confirming that he is under investigation. The agency says it can't comment on individual cases because of strict personal data protection rules. Mr Maassen said on X, formerly Twitter, that the letter did not contain ""substantial proof that the investigation was justified,"" adding that the government was afraid of him. He accuses the centre-left interior minister Nancy Faeser of using the intelligence services to fight political opponents. In the letter, security officials cite Mr Maassen's apparent belief in far-right and antisemitic conspiracy theories, his anti-migrant rhetoric and an alleged sympathy for the far-right Reichsbürger movement, members of which were arrested in December 2022 after a suspected failed coup. As head of domestic intelligence, Mr Maassen was accused of downplaying the threat of the far right. Over the years, he became increasingly vocal about the supposed dangers immigrants posed to German society, and his ferocious comments on social media turned him into an icon for the radical right. In 2018, he was forced out of office - officially sent into ""early retirement"" - after he appeared to doubt the veracity of a video showing xenophobic far-right violence at a street festival in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Since then, his comments have become more extreme. In an article entitled ""Chemotherapy for Germany,"" he compared migrants to cancer. Experts say Mr Maassen appears to have become ""radicalised"" - ironic for the ex-boss of an agency in charge of fighting radicalisation. He has also now confirmed that his new right-wing political party, the Values Union, which he launched at the end of January, would be happy to work with the far-right AfD to get into power after key upcoming regional elections. In an interview given to the German news agency DPA, he stopped short of saying that his party would aim to form a coalition with the AfD. But he confirmed that he would co-operate on individual draft laws in parliament and would have no problem relying on the far right to get into power. This would contradict the approach taken by all other political parties to reject cooperation with the AfD - the so-called ""firewall"". The Values Union is still a small, fringe movement. But Mr Maassen's willingness to break the longstanding taboo against working with the radical right shows how German politics is changing. Some members of the Values Union attended a now-notorious meeting in November at a lakeside hotel near Potsdam. During the meeting, which was also attended by high-ranking AfD members, participants discussed plans to stage mass deportations of migrants and people of non-German ethnic backgrounds. Ongoing mass demonstrations across Germany were trigged by the meeting becoming public knowledge last month. On Saturday, another large protest against the far right will be held in Berlin. The slogan: ""We are the firewall.""

hide caption Former President and 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's supporters attend a rally at Ted Hendricks Stadium in Hialeah, Fla., on Nov. 8, 2023. After more than a year of campaigning, door-knocking and a massive amount of ad spending, voters will finally have their say in the 2024 presidential election, starting Monday. Iowans will brave record-cold temperatures to cast the first ballots of this highly consequential year. And that's a word — consequential — that gets thrown around a lot when it comes to political campaigns. Presidential elections are always consequential. Presidents can affect social policy, through the courts and legislation, that can reshape the country. They can start wars or end them, embrace a role of leadership on the world stage – or retreat from it. Domestically, there is a particular volatility roiling American society. The country is undergoing significant change, from economics and technology to culture and politics. Undergirding this 2024 presidential election is a fight to own the outcome of the latest realignment in American politics. At its heart, this election is about what it means to be American, which values will win out for the future of what this country will be. The country is sharply divided on that. America has always been split on who should lead it. A presidential candidate, for example, hasn't gotten more than 53% in an election since 1984. Just four times since the popular vote has been tracked, dating back to 1824, has a candidate gotten above 60%, and the last time it happened — 1972 — that president, Richard Nixon, wound up resigning in disgrace. Today, partisanship and ideological sorting are more acute than arguably at any time since the Civil War. Americans are fractured by politics and at odds over the issues — from guns and global warming to immigration, abortion rights, education and beyond. Conservatives see a country changing, not for the better. They see the culture as too liberal, weak and enabling — with too many who talk down the good qualities of the country. Those left of center see their values, the marginalized and democracy itself in direct threat because of leaders who have given license to intolerance and conspiracy, while not having the majority of the country on their side. They're tired of what they see as minority rule. Democrats have won seven of the last eight popular votes in presidential elections, but only five presidencies in that time. The percentage of Americans calling themselves ""independents"" is at or near all-time highs. Gallup has found that 40% said so in December of 2023. That's understandable because neither party is very well liked – each was viewed unfavorably by about 60% of Americans in a Pew Research Center survey in September. And the people who identify as Democrats and Republicans have increasingly negative views of each other. But this increase in those calling themselves independents is something of a mirage. It doesn't really reflect how they vote, merely the decline in the party's brands. Estimates have shown that truly persuadable voters make up less than 10% of the population and are on the decline. That's meant that getting those voters to show up and swing in their candidate's direction has gotten more difficult and more expensive for campaigns. Voters in the ""middle"" hardly agree on the issues. The Pew Research Center has found that the country is more like eight or nine distinct political ideologies and that self-identified independents ""have very little in common politically."" That's why the idea of a third-party candidate magically appearing and unifying the country is, frankly, unlikely. They're unhappy with the state of the economy despite signs of improvement since the pandemic. They're unhappy with the overall direction of the country. Just 1 in 5 said they're satisfied with the direction of the country, according to Gallup, though they rate how things are going in their own personal lives much higher. They are less confident in the institutions that have been pillars of American society and democracy, at near-record lows in their trust in government – and it's only gotten worse. They're unhappy with the president – giving him low job approvals on everything from the economy to immigration to foreign policy. In fact, Biden had the lowest approval rating of any president since Truman at the same point in his presidency before a potential reelection bid. Loading... Americans think Biden is too old to be president, but they say they dislike his likely 2024 opponent, former President Donald Trump, even more. A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found 53% said they had an unfavorable view of Biden, and 56% said they had an unfavorable one of Trump. Despite Trump's popularity with his base, majorities of everyone else think the former president, who is facing 91 criminal counts, has done something illegal. What the effect of all that antipathy will be on this election isn't clear. Could it mean a decline in participation? Well, despite negative partisanship, voter turnout has only increased since the closely divided 2000 election. Anger, after all, is a key motivator. Could it mean an increase in protest votes? It certainly could, considering the negative views of both Biden and Trump, if both do become the nominees. There are already several third-party candidates running for office, who are threatening to peel off votes from both men. It's a major wild card and could introduce some surprises, and it all sets the stage for the presidential election that kicks off Monday with a GOP primary fight that features Republicans Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley hoping to unseat Trump as the head of the party – despite his historic leads in the polls.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-67992427,"Jersey's first female chief minister has lost her role following a vote of no confidence (VONC). Kristina Moore lost the vote with 27 supporting the VONC, 22 against and no abstentions in the States. The vote was brought by former infrastructure minister Tom Binet, who said he was unhappy with the way decisions were being made. The States Assembly now has to vote in a new chief minister, who will bring together a new council of ministers. Politicians spent the day debating for and against Ms Moore in the top job, concluding just before 19:45 GMT. After the vote, Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It never should have come to this."" She said: ""I'm deeply disappointed that States members have put personal relationships ahead of what is right for the island, particularly when we should be supporting islanders through what is a very challenging economic environment."" She added: ""I'm disappointed in myself in not maintaining the confidence of the assembly."" Deputy Binet said afterwards that it had been ""a grim day"" and something he had ""taken no pleasure in at all"". He said: ""I believe it is the right outcome, otherwise I wouldn't have done it."" He also confirmed that was planning to stand for the position. Constable Richard Vibert, an assistant minister, announced during the debate that he was resigning from government in order to back the vote of no confidence. During the debate, Education Minister Inna Gardiner spoke in support of Ms Moore, questioning if the public wanted the government to ""continue to discuss ourselves, or to get on with the job"". She said islanders needed ""a team that already knows the brief, a team that is already in the middle of the delivery plan, a team that already knows what they need to do and what they're expected to do"". David Warr, the housing minister, said he did not remember a time when the public said they were ""happy with the existing government"". ""I think the assembly has worked well together - the evidence is in the recently taken vote on the government plan, which was overwhelmingly supported by this assembly,"" he said. International Development Minister Carolyn Labey described the debate as an ""unedifying spectacle which will undoubtedly do Jersey harm"". She said it was ""embarrassing"" that the VONC was the first debate of 2024. She said: ""The whole island would rather see the elected members show more collaboration than confrontation."" Despite facing public criticism from Ms Moore over her refusal of the Les Sablons development, Deputy Hilary Jeune said she would support her to prioritise ""the larger mission over personal politics"". All 10 members of Reform Jersey had confirmed they would be backing the VONC on Monday, after leader Deputy Sam Mezec said the current government had ""no vision for taking Jersey forward"". Deputy Steve Luce also backed the VONC, saying the government ""should be working together for the benefit of our island"". He said: ""Working together is something Deputy Binet gets - he has convinced me there is an alternative way forward. ""We all know that the chief minister's job is not easy, and I certainly accept that; but there are ways to do things and there are ways not to do things."" Deputy Barbara Ward, who was newly voted into the States in 2022, said she had listened to parishioners and islanders and had come to the conclusion that change was ""desperately needed"".

https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-gender-gap-young-men-women-dont-agree-politics-2024-1,"Young men and women no longer agree on anything. What happened? Young men and women no longer agree on anything. What happened?        Something strange is happening between Gen Z men and women. Over the past decade, poll after poll has found that young people are growing more and more divided by gender on a host of political issues. Since 2014, women between the ages of 18 and 29 have steadily become more liberal each year, while young men have not. Today, female Gen Zers are more likely than their male counterparts to vote, care more about political issues, and participate in social movements and protests. While the gender gap is an enduring feature of American politics, at no time in the past quarter century has there been such a rapid divergence between the views of young men and women. The startling speed of the change suggests something more significant is going on than just new demographic patterns, such as rising rates of education or declining adherence to a religion — the change points to some kind of cataclysmal event. After speaking with more than 20 Gen Zers, my colleagues at the Survey Center on American Life and I found that among women, no event was more influential to their political development than the #MeToo movement. In 2017, women around the world began speaking out about their experiences with sexual assault and harassment. Gen Zers were then in high school and college, and for them, the movement came at a formative moment. ""Luckily I had that all over social media to shape the way I look at dating and men,"" a 21-year-old woman told us about #MeToo. She said it allowed her ""to use other people's experiences to form a sense of putting a guard up."" A 20-year-old woman offered a similar take — that #MeToo empowered her to stand up for herself: ""I think it makes me less of a doormat."" As I've written previously, the #MeToo movement united women politically. Although the challenges women face vary dramatically in the US, sexual harassment is a ubiquitous experience impacting women across lines of social class, politics, age, and race. Eight in 10 women say they have been sexually harassed at some point in their lives — and addressing that reality quickly became central for women. After the inauguration of Donald Trump, hundreds of thousands of women marched on Washington in the largest single-day protest in American history. But while women were rallying together, many Gen Z men began to feel like society was turning against them. As recently as 2019, less than one-third of young men said that they faced discrimination, according to Pew, but today, close to half of young men believe they face at least some discrimination. In a 2020 survey by the research organization PRRI, half of men agreed with the statement: ""These days society seems to punish men just for acting like men."" It increasingly feels like Gen Z men and women are living on different planets, each guided by the belief that they are navigating uniquely hostile terrain — and understanding why is crucial to bridging the gap. The #MeToo movement established a sense of solidarity among young women. A survey conducted in 2022 found that two-thirds of young women believe that in most or in every way, what happens to women in the US will have a bearing on their own lives — an idea known as ""linked fate"" in sociology. But this sentiment was not shared by older women: Only 36% of women older than 65 said the same. This bond has bled into Gen Z women's politics, especially around issues like abortion. A survey we conducted after Roe v. Wade was overturned and just before the 2022 midterms found that no issue mattered more for young women than abortion: 61% said it was a critical concern, while only 32% of young men said the same. In the 2022 midterm elections, all young voters strongly supported Democratic candidates, but young women demonstrated much greater support than men. Gen Z women have also united around the importance of female leadership and representation. A recent Pew poll found that 72% of women aged 18 to 29 believe there are too few women serving in ""high political offices,"" a steep jump from the roughly half of women over 50 and less than half of young men who said the same. More than seven in 10 young women said that the lack of female representation in political office is because women are held to higher standards than men. This newfound solidarity among women is also showing up in the workplace. For decades a strong majority of men and women alike had reported a clear preference for a male boss. But the percentage of women who said they preferred a male boss plummeted 12 points between 2014 and 2017. By that year, the year of the most recent polling, a majority of women reported preferring a female boss for the first time. At the same time, women's dissatisfaction with the status quo has only intensified. In 2016, 61% of women said they were satisfied with the way women are treated in American society, according to a Gallup survey. Today, that has dropped to 44%. As women's political priorities have solidified, young men's priorities have melted into mush. Surveys consistently show that young men are far less likely than women to say any particular issue is personally important to them. A survey we conducted last year found that young women expressed statistically significant greater concern for 11 out of 15 different issues, including drug addiction, crime, climate change, and gun violence. There was not a single issue that young men cared about significantly more than young women. Young men are also unhappy. For a growing number, feminism has less to do with promoting gender equality and more to do with simply attacking men. A 2022 survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that 46% of Democratic men under 50 agreed that feminism has done more harm than good — even more Republican men agreed. In our recent poll, roughly one in four male Gen Zers said they have experienced more gender discrimination than older men. And less than half of Gen Z men identified as feminists, with only half saying they support the #MeToo movement, compared to 72% of women. One young man we interviewed said he didn't pay much attention to #MeToo: ""It just seemed like a bit of buzz going on around celebrities, and awful things are happening in the world all the time. If I did ponder, it would bring me down and so I just choose to not even pay attention."" Another said #MeToo was just something he picked up from ""a woman's study class"" in college but not anything that he thinks much about. The lack of interest could be because Gen Z men have their own issues. Richard Reeves, the founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, has meticulously documented the challenges facing young men in America: They are struggling more in school, are less likely than women to go to and graduate from college, have fewer close friends than previous generations, and are four times as likely to commit suicide than women. Reeves argues that this state of affairs requires that we hold two seemingly contradictory ideas at once: Men at the highest rungs of the economic ladder are still advantaged by a system that perpetuates gender inequality, while men on the lower rungs of society face unique challenges because they are men. While women have turned to the left for answers to their problems, men are finding support on the right. Trump helped redefine conservatism as a distinctly masculine ideology, stoking grievances and directing young men's frustration toward liberals and feminists. There are signs the message is resonating: Republican affiliation among white men aged 18 to 24 jumped from 28% in 2019 to 41% in 2023, according to a Harvard Youth Poll. Outside politics, right-leaning figures such as Andrew Tate, Elon Musk, and Jordan Peterson are attracting young men looking for an ideological home. Most young men are probably not interested in making America great again, but they do feel acutely the need to secure a place for themselves in a culture that readily identifies male advantage but ignores the challenges young men face. Out of a sense of increased insecurity, more young men are adopting a zero-sum view of gender equality — if women gain, men will inevitably lose. It's an outlook that makes them defensive, encourages them to ignore or overlook enduring challenges women face in society, and can even spur misogyny. As one 35-year-old man told Pew in 2022 about #MeToo: ""Too many people are taking advantage of a serious situation because it's trendy or they are greedy or just want attention."" And this attitude has real-world consequences: In the online gaming world, 75% of Gen Z women have reported experiencing harassment. An oft-cited statistic that conveys the enduring absurdity of the gender gap is that until very recently, there were more CEOs named John than CEOs who are women. Across most industries, from politics to academia, men in American society still control more resources, earn higher wages, and enjoy more prestige. But few young men have any experience in the boardroom, and in the classroom, it's their female peers who are crushing it. But both genders are feeling increasingly precarious — and it's causing them to drift further apart. A recent Washington Post editorial lamented what this growing political divide means for dating and marriage: If Gen Z men and women can't agree on politics, it's going to get harder for them to find a partner. But if anything, that understates the problem. Based on our interviews, there appears to be a growing eagerness among both young men and women to blame their problems on each other. And a society in which men and women see their interests as irrevocably opposed is not one that can last.

The #MeToo movement has been particularly influential in shaping the political views of young women, leading to a sense of solidarity and increased political engagement. On the other hand, many young men feel society is turning against them, leading to a sense of discrimination and resentment. This divide is reflected in their political priorities, with young women prioritizing issues like abortion and female representation in political office. Young men, on the other hand, are less likely to prioritize specific issues and are increasingly turning to right-leaning ideologies for support.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/politics-and-local-laws-are-influencing-where-people-move-to-real-estate-agents-say-redfin-b32fc795,"Location used to be everything in real estate, but now it’s local laws that appear to be influencing where people want to buy homes, according to a new survey. One-third of real-estate agents say they have worked with buyers who moved over the last 12 months mainly because of state or local laws or politics, according to a new first-of-its-kind survey of 500 real-estate agents by brokerage Redfin 
        RDFN,
        -0.60%.
       Redfin agents say they’ve worked with clients who have wanted to move either to more liberal parts of the country or to more conservative areas. These moves have been influenced by gun laws, reproductive-rights laws and tax policies, the agents said. “State and local laws and politics have also become increasingly important as the nation gets more polarized, with Democrats and Republicans drifting further apart on issues like climate, immigration and education,” Redfin said in the report. With the U.S. Supreme Court striking down the constitutional protection of a woman’s right to abortion services in 2022 and states diverging on gun policies, many house hunters are rethinking where they would prefer to live. The Redfin survey looked at home buyers moving within the U.S. and not at people leaving the country. “State laws differ on partisan issues like abortion and gun control, with many Americans reporting they would prefer to live in a place with laws that align with their own views,” the report noted. “On a similar note, many Americans prefer living in a place where their neighbors have similar political views.” The Redfin survey only captured responses from real-estate agents about the clients whom they worked with. It does not mean that one-third of U.S. home buyers actually moved because of politics or local laws. Being able to afford to buy a home in the area where they currently live and living close to family and work “often outweigh” political preferences or local laws when people are choosing where they want to live, Redfin added. But with more people having the flexibility to work remotely, home buyers are able to make decisions about where they live based on political preferences and local laws, the report said. “A record share of homebuyers relocated to a different metro area in 2023. Some of the most common migration routes for homebuyers last year were from blue states to red or purple states: San Francisco to Austin; Seattle to Phoenix; New York to Orlando and other parts of Florida,” the report stated. Those are predominantly moves to cities where homes are more affordable. One agent with Redfin said that he had worked with a family who left New York for Florida but ended up coming back last year “because they preferred to live in a state with stricter gun laws.” Another Redfin agent, Austin-based Andrew Vallejo, said he had experienced a similar trend. “I know at least 10 people who have moved away from Texas in the last year, mainly because they don’t agree with state laws,” Vallejo said. “They all moved to the West Coast, to blue places where the policies align better with their personal views, specifically when it comes to women’s reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights.” At the same time, many people were moving from blue states to red states, Redfin noted, based on what the brokerage had heard from agents. “Many conservative states have policies that attract business-minded residents, like lower taxes and fewer restrictions on companies,” the company said in the report. “Other people leave blue states for red states to live near people with similar views; for instance, this couple moved from California to Idaho partly because they felt freedom to display a ‘Thin Blue Line’ banner,” the report said, referring to a banner expressing support for the police.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ex-u-k-finance-minister-kwasi-kwarteng-to-step-down-from-politics-480d5cca,"Kwasi Kwarteng, who served as the U.K.’s finance minister during the mini-budget crisis which saw Britain’s pound drop to its lowest ever levels against the U.S. dollar, has said he will not stand for reelection as a member of parliament. The British politician, who had previously worked for London hedge fund Odey Asset Management before being elected the MP for Skelthorpe in 2010, said that he will not stand in the U.K.’s upcoming general elections, which must be held by Jan. 28 2025 at the latest. Kwarteng, who also worked as a financial analyst at JP Morgan prior to entering politics, was given the job of finance minister by Britain’s shortest serving prime minister, Liz Truss, following her victory in an internal Conservative party vote in September 2022. The vote saw Truss take over from her predecessor, Boris Johnson, following the announcement of his resignation in July 2022, in the midst of a revolt among MPs over his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against Tory MP Chris Pincher. As chancellor, Kwarteng subsequently announced plans to implement a controversial “mini-budget,” which was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, that saw Britain’s sterling plunge to all -time lows. The mini-budget proposed an array of tax cuts that led to concerns among economists the U.K. would be forced to increase borrowing. The International Monetary Fund later called on Britain to “re-evaluate” its plans as it warned the mini-budget would “likely increase inequality.” The prime minister later asked Kwarteng to resign, just 38 days after taking up the post, as she replaced him with current Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, and reversed parts of the mini budget, in a bid to reassure financial markets. Truss herself became Britain’s shortest ever serving prime minister after resigning just 45 days after taking up office. Kwarteng became the U.K.’s second shortest serving chancellor after ex-Tory minister Iain MacLeod who died 13 days into his tenure, in July 1970. Born to Ghanaian parents in London in 1975, Kwarteng attended Britain’s prestigious Eton College before going on to study classics and history at Trinity College, Cambridge. He later studied at Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar before returning to Cambridge University to complete a PhD in the economic history of the Great Recoinage Crisis of 1696. Kwarteng separately faced scrutiny after the hedge fund owned by his former boss, Crispin Odey, was revealed to have made huge gains by shorting the pound, just weeks after Odey met the ex-finance minister for lunch. Odey later shut Odey Asset Management, in October 2023, after a Financial Times investigation raised allegations the hedge fund manager had sexually harassed and assaulted 13 women. Kwarteng said he will continue serving as MP for Skelthorpe until the end of his term. MarketWatch contacted Kwarteng’s parliamentary office for comment. Total consumer credit rose $1.5 billion in December, down from a $23.4 billion gain in the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. Louis Goss is a MarketWatch reporter based in London.

https://www.businessinsider.com/which-republicans-voted-against-impeaching-dhs-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas-2024-2,"       House Republicans failed on Tuesday evening to impeach Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, a stunning setback for House Speaker Mike Johnson and another example of the chaos surrounding his chamber. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting down what would have been the first impeachment of a Cabinet official in nearly 150 years. The final vote was 214 to 216. Reps. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Ken Buck of Colorado, and Tom McClintock of California all voted against the impeachment. Rep. Blake Moore of Utah switched his vote at the last minute to ""no"" so that the chamber can bring it up again. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise missed the vote. He has been away from Washington for treatment for multiple myeloma. It is unclear if or when the GOP will return to the topic. Republicans were set to have a narrow majority after the 2022 midterms, but the GOP has narrowed its power even further. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned from Congress after his ouster. In a historic move, the House also voted to expel Rep. George Santos of New York. ""Miss me yet?"" Santos wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, with an apparent picture of the vote when both sides were tied. Gallagher's opposition is particularly notable given that he leads the House's select committee focused on China, a high-profile post in the Capitol. Gallagher has been considered a rising star in his party and was wooed for a potential US Senate bid this November. Two of the other Republicans who opposed impeachment, Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Tom McClintock of California had long questioned the case against Mayorkas, especially whether the two articles against him met the constitutional bar for impeachment. McClintock has also repeatedly warned that impeaching Mayorkas would establish a troubling precedent that could be abused by future Congresses by essentially saying an official could be impeached if they are viewed as being bad at their job. Mayorkas' impeachment was not expected to go anywhere. Democrats and lawmakers aligned with the party narrowly control the Senate, making it tough for any impeachment to clear the high bar of 67 votes needed to convict. But senators from both parties have repeatedly made clear that they have a particular ire reserved for Mayorkas' impeachment. ""What's rich to me is the speaker says the [border] bill in the Senate is… dead on arrival,"" Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters, per Huff Post. ""And then they proceed impeaching a cabinet secretary, which is obviously dead on arrival."" Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, sounded similar to Buck and McClintock in questioning the case against Mayorkas. ""I haven't seen the Constitutional standard met yet,"" Romney told Axios. ""We'll see what they find in their investigation."" Before Tuesday's vote, McClintock issued a scathing 10-page letter to his colleagues denouncing their impeachment push. In a speech on the House floor, he went so far as to say, ""stunts like this don't help."" ""[T]aking the course outlined by the [Homeland Security Committee] is bad politics and bad policy,"" McClintock wrote in his letter. ""It is bad politics because it taints with partisanship what would otherwise be overwhelming national opposition to Democrats' open borders policy. It is bad policy because it strengthens a dangerous constitutional precedent the Democrats will surely use against conservatives on the Supreme Court and a future Republican administration the moment they have that opportunity.""

https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-openai-dean-phillips-campaign-chatbot-deanbot-2024-1,"       Late Friday night, OpenAI suspended a developer who had created Dean.Bot — a ChatGPT-powered chatbot intended to support Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips' 2024 presidential campaign — for violating new rules preventing lobbyists and candidates from using ChatGPT for politics, The Washington Post reported. Dean.Bot conversed with constituents in real time while mimicking the long shot Democratic challenger for president, using an AI-generated version of Phillips' voice to respond to user questions, like why Democrats shouldn't be throwing their weight behind incumbent President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. ""While I respect President Biden, the data and conversations with Americans across the country indicates a strong desire for change,"" WaPo reported Dean.Bot responded in an AI-generated voice that sounded like Phillips' but had an unusual cadence. Phillips' background is in business. He ran his family's distilling company between 2000 and 2012 before pivoting to run Talenti, the popular gelato company he'd invested in until it was sold in 2014. He has represented Minnesota since 2019 and launched his campaign to challenge Biden in October last year. However, his polling numbers haven't indicated he'd be a significant threat to Biden. The creation of Dean.Bot was funded by the Super PAC We Deserve Better, WaPo reported. The PAC then partnered with AI developer Delphi to build the bot. Delphi's account was suspended for violating the political rules late Friday, just a day after WaPo wrote about the creation of Dean.Bot. OpenAI earlier this month announced new rules preventing developers from building applications using its ChatGPT software intended for political campaigning or lobbying, saying the platform is ""still working to understand how effective our tools might be for personalized persuasion."" Representatives for OpenAI and Phillips' 2024 presidential campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. Despite OpenAI's new rules, Dean.Bot won't be the last AI creation we see this election season. The Hill reported Google and Meta have crafted policies requiring politicians and lobbyists to label content created by generative AI in campaign-related materials in response to a surge of AI-created content, including deepfakes and misleading audio. The outlet reported that several lawmakers, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Susan Collins, have also introduced congressional proposals to address AI use in advertisements. But viewers will need to keep their eyes peeled for AI-generated content this election season until those measures pass — if they pass at all.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-navigate-market-risk-from-the-fed-interest-rates-the-economy-and-presidential-politics-in-2024-1b331473,"As the U.S. Federal Reserve’s three-year reign in the headlines potentially comes to an end, an analysis of this year’s market themes can offer valuable insights for predicting trends and ensuring attractive returns in 2024. Beyond the central bank’s actions, pivotal factors shaping the investment landscape this year include fiscal policies, election outcomes, interest rates and earnings prospects. Throughout 2023, a prominent theme emerged: that equities are influenced by factors beyond monetary policy. That trend is likely to persist. A decline in interest rates could significantly increase the relative valuations of equities while simultaneously reducing interest expenses, potentially transforming market dynamics. Contrary to consensus estimates, 2023 brought a more robust earnings rebound, leaving analysts optimistic about 2024. The 2024 U.S. presidential election, meanwhile, introduces a new element of uncertainty with the potential to cast a shadow over the market during much of the coming year. Anticipating a choppy first half of the year due to sluggish economic growth, we see a better opportunity for cyclicals and small-cap stocks to rebound in the latter part of the year. As uncertainty around the election and recession fears dissipate, a broad rally that includes previously ignored cyclicals and small-caps should help propel the S&P 500 
        SPX
       higher. Broader macroeconomic conditions support mid-single-digit growth in earnings per share throughout 2024. Factors such as moderate economic expansion, controlled inflation and stable interest rates are expected to provide a conducive environment for companies, enabling them to sustain and potentially improve their earnings performance. We estimate EPS growth of 6.5%. This projected growth aligns with the broader market sentiment indicating a steady upward trajectory in earnings for the upcoming year, fostering investor confidence and supporting valuation expectations across various sectors. “ If the economy has not been in recession at the time of the first rate cut but enters one within a year, the Dow enters a bear market.” When it comes to U.S. stock-market performance around rate cuts, the phase of the economic cycle matters. When there has been no recession, lower rates have juiced the markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
        DJIA
       rallying by an average of 23.8% one year later. If the economy has not been in recession at the time of the first cut but enters one within a year, the Dow has entered a bear market every time, declining by an average of 4.9% one year later. Our base case is a soft landing, but history shows how critical avoiding recession is for the bull market as the Fed prepares to ease policy. This past year has posed a hurdle for small-cap stocks due to the absence of a driving force. These stocks typically perform better as the economy emerges from a recession. While they are currently undervalued, their earnings growth has been notably lacking. If concerns about a recession diminish, a normal yield curve could serve as a potential catalyst for small-cap stocks. The ongoing outperformance of megacap growth stocks that we saw in 2023 might hinge on their ability to sustain superior earnings growth, validating their current valuations. Defensive sectors in the value category, meanwhile, are notably oversold and might exhibit strong performance, particularly toward the latter part of the first quarter. Should concerns about a recession dissipate, cyclical sectors within the value category could outperform, particularly if broader market conditions turn favorable in the latter half of the year. The Fed’s enduring influence regarding the prospect of a soft landing in 2024 remains a pivotal point in the market’s focus. Considering the themes of the past year and the multifaceted influences on equities beyond monetary policy, investors are advised to navigate through uncertainties stemming from unintended fiscal shifts, upcoming elections and the impact of fluctuating interest rates. While a potentially choppy start to the year is anticipated, it could create opportunities for cyclical and small-cap stocks later in the year.

https://www.businessinsider.com/david-gushee-christian-nationalists-support-trump-reelection-authoritarianism-2024-1,"       As we head into one of the most significant election years the nation has faced in recent history, David Gushee, a Baptist pastor and professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University, warns that democracy itself is facing a grave threat from an unlikely source: his fellow Christians. In his latest book, ""Defending Democracy from its Christian Enemies,"" Gushee examines why the Christian right in America has been so powerfully seduced by authoritarian ideology from prominent GOP leaders like Donald Trump and why, if we're not vigilant about the threat he represents, Americans could be ushering in a democracy-free future with open arms. What prompted you to look into Christian nationalism, authoritarianism, and democracy for your latest book? This book responds to a crisis that I see, especially in the US — but not only here — and that is that democracy itself is losing support, either explicitly or implicitly, and that a lot of the people who are weakening their support of democracy or abandoning it entirely are Christians, and they were motivated by what they would consider to be Christian motivations. My dissertation was on the Nazi era and the Holocaust. I'm a strong believer in democracy, and I also have a lot of knowledge about what happens when democracy is abandoned, and it's not good, so I'm very passionate about protecting it. Is there a particular incident or flash point that you see as of significant concern about the challenges that are facing democracy? In the US, the immediate crisis is the phenomenon of Donald Trump and the strong conservative Christian support for Trump, which continues to this day. It went to a whole new level when he refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and was determined not to leave the White House, and then helped to trigger a violent attack on the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. And now in his campaign for the 2024 election, he's speaking in openly authoritarian ways. Some statements are even more alarming than things that he has said in the past. So you have a uniquely dangerous politician in the history of American politics, but you also have this stubbornly loyal base of support for this man from conservative Christians, and that is what I'm trying to explore in the book. What's the secret? Why the support? And I think I've got it pretty well figured out. And so that's what the book does, while also challenging it and saying: We got to do better than that. Can you tell me a little bit more about the reasons that you've found why Donald Trump has such a significant base among Christian conservatives? My hypothesis is that there's a reactionary dynamic on the part of many morally and religiously traditionalist people, which could be Christians, Muslims, or Jewish people. In historically Christian-dominated countries like the US, the basic formula is you have a population that is used to being in control of politics and culture. And they're losing or have lost that control because of political, legal, and cultural changes over many decades. The cultural changes that have happened in the US since the 1960s have not been accepted by many traditional Christians. These would be things like legal abortion, legal same-sex relationships, the feminist movement, and the sexual revolution. In different countries, it's different things, but for the US, that includes large-scale immigration from non-European countries and, I would also say, sadly, the significant racial backlash to a multiracial society with equal rights for people of color. My hypothesis is that the constant liberalizing and pluralizing of American culture has evoked a rather fierce reaction on the part of a chunk of the population that you could put at maybe 25%, mostly conservative Catholics, evangelicals, fundamentalists, Pentecostals, and maybe some people of other religions too. The initial strategy of the politically active reactionaries was to re-evangelize the country through church work and then to partner with the Republican Party to elect politicians like Ronald Reagan who would advance their moral agenda. And then, in turn, the evangelicals, the fundamentalists, and so on would support Reagan and the Republican Party. That's the kind of traditional Christian right strategy that goes back to the 70s. My assessment is that Trump, in one sense, was just the latest product of that partnership. But in another sense, when they followed him right over the cliff to insurrection and authoritarianism, you're talking about an entirely new stage. So you've got the reactionary part, the authoritarian part, which is resistant to social changes that they don't like and so are galvanized by the authoritarianism of a man like Trump, and you have a percentage of people who are willing to sacrifice democracy to get what they want politically. And what, from your perspective, would that look like if that's the sacrifice that's being made? What are the potential consequences there? It would have meant that if Trump had managed to pull off a coup on January 6 and had managed to stay in the White House despite losing the election, they would have supported him. If Trump were to get elected again and propose abolishing the two-term limit, they would support that, too. It could also look like repudiating the First Amendment, which guarantees religious liberty and disestablishment of religion, and saying, 'No, we're going to officially enshrine Christian values into the Constitution.' It could include weakening the independence of the judiciary, throwing political opponents in jail, weakening all available checks and balances to the government, or intimidating the media so that you wouldn't have honest, critical reporting of what was going on. And in the book I talked about various strategies that have been tried in different countries. I also point out that there are these conservative Christian scholars who are so disillusioned about the results of democracy as we have it in this country that they also are supportive of a serious reconsideration of how we do democracy here. And they might favor some kind of return to an officially Christian state with Christian morality essentially dictated by law and Christianity being enshrined legally and in culture as the official source of the laws and values of the United States. You mention that there might be roughly about 25% of the population that's really kind of reactionary and committed to this authoritarian ideology. Since they're not a majority, how much damage could they do? The thing about radical politics is you don't have to have 51% for a radical political strategy to prevail in a country. What you need is a significantly committed minority and then enough other people who are either intimidated or who are simply willing to go along because they don't quite see what is at stake or, on the whole, they prefer authoritarian politics, which has results that they might go for instead of democracy, which has results that they don't like. So you don't have to have a majority as long as you can combine your hardcore true believers plus people who are willing to accommodate it. If you look at the 2024 election, if Trump is the candidate saying some of the things he's already saying, all you would need would be, you know, 25 or 30% of the vote that is hardcore that go with him over a cliff, but then another roughly 20% who say yeah, on balance, I'd still rather have this outcome then the Democrats winning. Based on what you've described, it sounds like the threat is not just limited to the idea of Donald Trump having another second term but really more existential to how our system functions. Yes. It's an overall worldview. The worldview is that the kind of civilization we should want is Christian. Officially Christian. Robustly Christian. And they believe that the country will continue to decline and liberalize unless a Christian strong man comes in and says, 'No, this is how it's going to be here. You don't know what's in your own best interest. I am going to tell you what the laws are going to be and we, the Christian, traditionalist community, are going to tell you what the laws are going to be.' So that's not about Trump. It's about an aggrieved population that does not like what they see in culture or in law, and they think that democracy has failed because it doesn't have an adequate moral or religious basis, and it's just kind of spinning off into chaos. It seems hard to argue against that ideology if it's a fundamental belief that the nation should be a Christian one in order to be a moral one. What's the argument against that? Part of what I do in the book is to review the arguments of Christian dissenting groups in England and the early US, who argued for the separation of church and state, the disestablishment of religion, freedom of conscience, and freedom of religion, precisely on Christian terms. They said the state has no business dictating matters of fundamental conscience to people. That conscience belongs to God, not to the state. And they also said that when that kind of power is concentrated in the hands of political authorities, it is always abused. The early Baptists did not call on Christians to stop caring about the moral tone or direction of culture, but just not to use the coercive power of the state to enforce their vision. So these are some of the arguments that we need to recover because I think many Christians have lost contact with the dissenting pro-democracy strands of the Christian tradition that helped to create this country. And how does Trump become the face of this movement if he's not what would be considered the typical embodiment of Christian values? You don't need a strongman to be a good person if he delivers what you want. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. But Vladimir Putin has the support of a lot of conservative Christians in Russia because he delivers things that they want, like opposition to homosexuality, standing up against the liberal West, that kind of thing. What's interesting is evangelicals have had to learn how to hold their nose and support Trump. It wasn't an immediate reaction on the part of a lot of them. But what Trump had, compared to a more classic conservative Christian like George W. Bush, was a ruthlessness and transactionalism saying, 'Hey, go with me and I'll make Christmas great again, and I'll make America great again, and everybody will know that this is basically your country, our country.' As you're speaking, I'm thinking about Donald Trump in comparison to Mike Pence, who seems to me to be someone who is maybe perhaps more embodying those traditional ideals. I wonder, though, because there has been such a disdain for Mike Pence that has erupted even among that same kind of faith-based community, what do you make of the cannibalization of Pence, who would otherwise seem to really embody those ideals? Pence versus Trump is the great case study of what has changed. Pence was indeed the embodiment of old-school, Midwestern straight-arrow evangelical politics. But he actually believed in democracy. And when the electoral votes just didn't turn out how his team wanted, he wasn't going to violate the Constitution to block the certification of the election. And that was after lots and lots and lots of compromise with Trump. I mean, he bent over backward to try to be a loyal vice president. But he wouldn't do what Trump demanded on January 6, and then he tried not to say much about it. When he finally did say stuff about it, he spoke about it clearly. So, I think Pence got stuck in a tragic no man's land. The old Christian Right that's about values and character and faithfulness to one wife and all that is weakened, almost dead. The new Christian Right is about tribalism, Trumpism, and authoritarianism. He didn't fit. And so Pence was doomed. And what has gradually emerged is an amoral 'the ends justify the means' kind of politics. And, for you, as someone who's part of the faith, does that rattle your belief system seeing how this extremist ideology has co-opted this religious population? I decided some years ago that American fundamentalist and evangelical Christianity was not my home. I did identify as an evangelical Christian for a long time, but I'm glad that I have left. There's something really toxic there. But that doesn't rattle my faith in that my faith in Jesus is not related to the malformed monstrosity that has emerged since, say, 2015. I understand it to be an aberration and a disastrous one. And I know lots and lots and lots of Christian people who also know it to be a disaster and who have rejected it utterly. I used to say to my students: there's no one version of Christianity, there's many versions. This is just a particularly disastrous one. It just needs to be called out for what it is. And are you hopeful in our ability to overcome this disaster? Going back to the political side, let's say the question is: will our democracy survive? We have strengths in our political system built in over 240 years, that are not easy to be overturned. A free press, separation of powers, the military not being involved in politics, an independent judiciary, watchdog groups, and the civil society we have. We have a lot of strengths, and Trump's best effort to overcome those checks and balances failed. I would hope that they would fail again, but it is still the case that a substantial number of people are telling pollsters that they would vote for him as if none of what happened in the Trump era has really registered. If we lose our democracy because Trump somehow gets reelected and then, say, he doesn't want to leave power, we would have earned it. We would have gone into it with eyes wide open as a country. I don't think it will happen, but I'm concerned about it. But again, because it's not only about Trump and because you've got a significant minority of the population that is seduced by the authoritarian temptation right now, then vigilance about this will need to continue long after 2024. Do other politicians exhibit the same existential threat to democracy? And, if so, what does the battle against that look like? There are state-level Christian theocrats who are in some ways implementing as much of an authoritarian reactionary Christian agenda as they can. But so far, they're doing it more or less within the limits of the democratic process; they're not staying in office after they lose or something. But then you have the people who are more like mini-Trump figures who ran on election denial and who would be all on board to do more of the same, but they tended to lose in 2022, which is encouraging. It does appear that, especially in red-state America, there are experiments underway to enforce a certain vision of Christian values. So the agenda is there. But there's not, I think, a single individual who has the combination of platform, charisma, and following that Trump has. So what do Christian communities do now to push back on this creeping authoritarianism? In the book, I named three traditions of Christian resistance to authoritarianism. One is the dissenting pro-democratic tradition as embodied by the Baptists. Another is the tradition of covenantal thinking, in which it is understood that a political community is like a community of people who are in covenant with each other, making a promise to one another to care about the well-being of everybody and to respect everybody's rights. So, the language of covenant. And then I mentioned the Black Christian, pro-democratic tradition in the US. For hundreds of years, Black Americans have understood better than anybody the flaws of our democracy and how hard you have to fight to have a real democracy. And so, all of us, people of all racial and ethnic identifications and backgrounds, need to study that tradition and listen to the current leaders like Reverend William Barber and others who articulate that tradition with vividness. It seems like leaning on Black Christian leaders for guidance here might be something those reactionary thinkers who feel challenged by the civil-rights movement might not be willing to do. One way to interpret what's gone wrong is that America's democracy was always damaged by white supremacy because of allowing and enshrining slavery and then allowing and enshrining Jim Crow, lynching, then segregation. All that has been protested by African Americans and their allies for hundreds of years. And when this ferocious backlash begins on the white Christian side, it's very tightly connected to the civil rights era. And so one way to focus on the racial dimension of the reactionary move is a certain percentage of white Americans who say 'no, we prefer 18th-century versions of democracy where white people are in charge. We don't like this thing where Barack Obama, a man of his background and race, could become president. This society belongs to white people.' To me, that is what Donald Trump has exuded most powerfully in his entire adult political career. And so it's either we either move forward into genuine multiracial, equal democratic citizenship or we are pushed backward into something like white ethnocratic quasi-democracy, and I think there are people who really want that.

https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/25/trudeau-tucker-carlson-canada-00137995,"Canada Alberta’s premier is also under fire for her appearance with the far-right star. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson made two appearances in Alberta on Wednesday to sold-out crowds in Calgary and Edmonton. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images By Zi-Ann Lum 01/25/2024 07:39 PM EST Updated:
01/26/2024 05:11 AM EST Link Copied CALGARY, Alberta — Justin Trudeau and his ministers fired back on Thursday against a political provocateur from south of the border: Tucker Carlson. With speeches in Alberta that trashed Canada’s government, mocked LGBTQ people and knocked mainstream media, Carlson triggered outrage in Ottawa and furnished himself to the Trudeau team as an irresistible political target. The prime minister and his allies have spent months now linking their domestic political rivals to American-style “MAGA” politics. Carlson’s message, they argued Thursday, was conclusive evidence of Trumpism politics seeping into Canada. “Don’t ask the question if it’s coming to Canada,” Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez said. “It’s already here.” Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, the first openly gay MP to be elected in Alberta, called Carlson “the mouthpiece of the MAGA Conservative far-right” and denounced his hateful comments about LGBTQ people — homophobic and transgender jokes throughout the day. “It’s deplorable and we won’t stand for it,” he said. Ottawa’s response to Carlson amplified the American-style culture war that’s settling into the tone of Canadian politics in the run up to an election expected in 2025. Carlson’s self-described mission to “liberate Canada” manifested Wednesday as a sold-out matinee for 4,000 in Calgary and a stadium show for 8,000 in Edmonton, confirming 
“whitelash” and grievance politics resonate with a deep-pocketed audience in Alberta. The former prime-time star who reportedly earned 
$20 million a year at Fox News warned the Calgary crowd that their wealth and power is threatened by Ottawa politicians. His afternoon show offered two hours of catharsis during which the former Fox News anchor made the case for rage as a sensible response to anything Canadians might be experiencing in these post-pandemic days. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith joined Carlson on stage to discuss energy politics and her own ongoing war with Ottawa. Smith, a self-described libertarian conservative, was sought out by event organizers after Carlson announced in November that he was heading north to stir up trouble. During her back and forth with Carlson, Smith complained about Ottawa and encouraged Carlson to target Canada’s environment minister. “I wish you would put Steven Guilbeault in your crosshairs,” she said to loud cheers and applause. In Ottawa on Thursday, Guilbeault accused Smith of normalizing rhetoric that could be interpreted as an incitement of political violence. “We can bang our fists on the table when we meet, we can have strong disagreement, but to incite violence against people who disagree with you, that’s not how things should be done in Canada,” he said. The Liberals spent last fall using 
Trump as a political foil, launching attack ads comparing Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s team to MAGA Republicans — a tactic the party intends to keep up into the next election. On Thursday Guilbeault rejected suggestions that Liberals are trying to compare Poilievre to Donald Trump. Instead, the Liberals tried to draw out the Conservative leader, challenging Poilievre to condemn the “hateful and violent words.” On stage in Calgary, Carlson made jokes about the LBGTQ community and used the prime minister as a punchline. The audience laughed along. Trudeau made just passing mention of Carlson on Thursday during his opening remarks at the Liberal caucus retreat, though he accused Poilievre of being an apologist for Vladimir Putin after Conservatives voted against updates to a Canada-Ukraine free-trade deal. “Pierre Poilievre and his Conservatives chose to vote against support for Ukraine, calling it a faraway foreign land to appease Putin apologists, like Tucker Carlson and those who enable him,” Trudeau said. Neither Ukraine nor Russia came up on stage in Calgary. Carlson, instead, spent the bulk of his time championing the rights of parents while blaming progressives and liberals — and especially the Trudeau government — for just about everything. Politics in every country features frauds, he said, “maybe especially including my country.” He added: “I would know. It’s the one thing I know a lot about.” The close of his 20-minute keynote served as a pep talk, hyping Albertans for an existential war. “You need to change inside. Your attitudes need to change and your timidity needs to be replaced by bravery,” he said before throwing in a bit of conspiracy theory to complete his point.

Nineteen children and two teachers died. The report reveals the most significant failure was the officers' failure to classify the incident as an active shooter scenario and do everything possible to stop the threat. Instead, they treated the attack as a barricaded subject scenario, where police are encouraged to negotiate. A few hundred Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv last night to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and peace with Palestinians as the war between Hamas and Israel continues.

Voters have been left with whatever beams into their living rooms or flashes across their devices on any given night: Donald Trump. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO By Adam Wren 01/28/2024 07:00 AM EST Link Copied The biggest lesson from the unfolding GOP nominating process this year — aside from Donald Trump’s dominance — is that all politics is now national, a reversal of former Speaker Tip O’Neill’s truism which held the opposite: that all politics is local. That’s a real problem for Nikki Haley, Trump’s last remaining serious challenger, as her allies scour the electoral map for friendlier terrain. A fast-twitch news cycle, declining local news and political action committees carpet-bombing the early states have sanded away regional quirks and pet issues. Racking up stops on Iowa’s 
Pizza Ranch circuit and trudging through New Hampshire’s snowpacks doing the diner-to-town hall dash matters less than ever. How is it, after all, that some 230,000 votes cast in two vastly different states during a competitive primary all went for the same candidate? “We’ve nationalized and so tribalized ourselves on social media — and the ability to communicate directly with voters goes around that filter — that Tip O’Neill’s old rules do not apply,” said Mike Madrid, the Republican strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. What’s left, Madrid said, is a deadening sameness to our politics that transcends not only state but international borders. “There’s a very good argument that white rural, non-college-educated voters in Pennsylvania have more in common with rural, non-college-educated voters in England that voted for Brexit as opposed to voters in a more diverse urban core — college-educated voters in London and New York,” said Madrid, who is at work on a book about the trend. Disappearing along with those state-specific contours? Favorite-daughter status for Haley in her native South Carolina, where she was a popular two-term governor — and at the very moment she needs it most. Returning to the state after her defeat in New Hampshire, Haley urged supporters to remember “you have been with me before.” But there’s a reason she is polling 30 percentage points behind Trump in her home state. The first in the South primary has “been nationalized since last year,” said Republican state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, who backed Ron DeSantis before declaring his support for Trump. Even if she had the backing of her former political allies, it may not do anything to change the race. DeSantis couldn’t parlay support from Iowa’s popular Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, into a victory in the first caucus state — nor did support from Bob Vander Plaats’ evangelical machine help. The following week, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu campaigned hard for Haley in his state, and that wasn’t enough. In both states, Trump cleared over 50 percent of the vote. Polls suggest it’s the same story in South Carolina. In this nationalized climate, Kimbrell said, Haley’s time as governor loses any luster. “I don’t think she has a chance to pull South Carolina,” Kimbrell said. “It’s going to be a yawning victory for the former president.” In Iowa, DeSantis’ vaunted ground game, marquee endorsements and stubborn commitment to do “Iowa the right way,” as he said, amounted to winning precisely zero counties. Trump won handily, even as his opponents poured tens of millions into the state — more than five times the amount Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Trump and John Kasich spent on Super Tuesday combined in 2016. “It turns out that all the money in the world, 99-county tours and endorsements by the biggest political leader in the state and the biggest evangelical leader in the state was not enough to beat Donald Trump,” said David Kochel, the longtime Iowa Republican strategist. “Cable news and all the progressive and conservative media ecosystems tend to treat this all as a big national storyline. And then people follow it that way.” They did in New Hampshire, too, even with its vastly different electorate. Mavericks needed not apply. After all, New Hampshire did not, as Haley suggested, “correct” Iowa’s vote. This, even as Haley and her allies spent millions campaigning in the state. The old way of campaigning in New Hampshire — campaigns reaching out to potential voters at house parties and hoping they, in turn, tell others — is on life support. Campaigns did far less voter contact this time around: Only 
23 percent of probable Republican primary voters interviewed in the closing days of the campaign by a Monmouth University-Washington Post poll said they’d been personally contacted by someone encouraging them to support one of the candidates. That was down sharply from the same poll in February 2016, in which 49 percent of Republican primary voters said they’d been personally contacted. Absent a friendly door knock from a familiar face, or any face at all, voters have been left with whatever beams into their living rooms or flashes across their devices on any given night: An ad from a super PAC featuring Trump, talking heads chattering about Trump, Trump himself in a courtroom.

January 25, 2024 05:00 AM Just ask DeSantis. He cited Trump’s indictments as 
a regret, saying they “distorted” and “sucked out a lot of oxygen” from the race. Perhaps no Republican strategist working the 2024 campaign has had a more unique vantage point into this new dynamic than Kory Wood, a consultant from the firm Ascent Strategic. At the same time he was serving as a senior adviser on Vivek Ramaswamy’s American Exceptionalism political action committee, steering the entity through a presidential race, he was also managing a mayoral race in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel. Down that mayoral race’s homestretch, the Democratic candidate tried to inject national politics into the race, demanding Wood’s client, a Republican, denounce Moms for Liberty, the culture warrior group. As she weathered attacks, Wood’s candidate kept telling him she just wanted to talk about filling potholes. He told her that wouldn’t work. In this current environment, “fix the damn roads” — a phrase Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer famously used in her 2018 campaign — was no longer what voters wanted to hear about. “What’s happening in Washington, D.C.,” Wood said, “is driving the narrative.” Steven Shepard contributed to this report.

Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and author of ""Woke, Inc."", announced Monday night he is suspending his presidential campaign. ""We did not achieve the surprise that we wanted to deliver tonight,"" he said. Ramaswamy, who predicted to Axios in October a ""solid second or third"" finish in the Iowa caucuses, came in fourth in the first presidential contest. Former President Donald Trump dominated the caucuses. Ramaswamy has endorsed Trump for the nomination. On the campaign trail, Ramaswamy tried to emphasize ""America First"" policies, a stance that has proven popular with supporters of Trump. ""I wouldn't call myself a disciple of Donald Trump,"" Ramaswamy told NPR last May. ""I would embrace the label of 'America First' to point out that 'America first' is bigger than Donald Trump. It does not belong to Donald Trump."" Ramaswamy said his campaign was centered on bringing back a sense of national identity. ""I'm looking at a need in our country and a job that needs to be done that I see very few people stepping up to actually deliver, which is to answer what it even means to be an American today — to revive our missing national identity, especially in the next generation of Americans,"" he said. His policy proposals ranged from cutting the Federal Reserve workforce by at least 90%, deporting American-born children of undocumented immigrants, and raising the voting age to 25. As a vocal member of the ""anti-woke"" movement, the former entrepreneur claimed his presidency would fight against ""woke"" policies. But his campaign was also marked by his amplification of conspiracy theories — including that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was an ""inside job"", the 2020 election was stolen, and his comments that the ""Great Replacement theory,"" which has origins in white supremacist ideology, is part of the Democratic Party's platform. His persona also drew criticism from his competitors. During a GOP debate, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley called Ramaswamy ""scum"" after he commented on Haley's parenting and brought up her daughter. Haley also attacked Ramaswamy for his position on the war in Ukraine, saying, ""You have no foreign policy experience and it shows."" In another debate, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Ramaswamy ""the most obnoxious blowhard in America."" Before venturing into politics, Ramaswamy founded his biotech and pharmaceutical company, Roivant Sciences Ltd. In 2022, he founded Strive Asset Management, an ""anti-woke"" index fund provider.

hide caption A credit card is placed into a machine for processing payments on Sept. 11 in La Puente, Calif. The Biden administration wants to stop financial institutions from charging fees to customers who try to make purchases without enough money in their accounts and are immediately denied. It's the latest salvo in the government's campaign against so-called ""junk fees,"" which President Biden said last year harm ""working folks"" and drive up costs for consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Wednesday that it was proposing a rule to bar banks, credit unions and other institutions from immediately denying a customer's transaction for insufficient funds to cover it and then levying a fee on top of that. ""Banks should be competing to provide better products at lower costs, not innovating to impose extra fees for no value,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. Some financial institutions allow customers to ""overdraft"" their accounts, meaning the customer spends more money than they have on hand. The bank lends them the extra cash and charges an overdraft fee. The CFPB wants to stop financial institutions from charging the customer a fee after denying a transaction for insufficient funds. Regulators said companies almost never charge such fees, but emphasized that they were proposing the rule proactively to prevent such fees from becoming more mainstream in the future. Critics in the financial sector who have pushed back against the Biden administration's war on ""junk fees"" questioned why the CFPB would attempt to bar a fee that's uncommon. ""Today's CFPB press release conjures up a bank fee that the Bureau itself concedes few – if any – banks charge and proposes a rule to prevent banks from charging this mysterious fee in the future,"" said Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. ""As an independent regulator, the Bureau should leave politics to the campaign trail,"" Nichols added. Earlier this month, the CFPB announced a plan to lower overdraft fees to as low as $3 or allow banks to charge higher fees if they showed regulators their cost data.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68141420,"Voters have criticised a Conservative MP who claimed he could not afford to pay his mortgage on a £118,300 ministerial salary. Mid Norfolk MP George Freeman quit as science minister in November, in order to take other jobs to make ends meet. Constituent Jamie Langham said he had ""no sympathy"" for the MP. However, Bill Borrett, chairman of Mid Norfolk Conservative Association, defended Mr Freeman and said he had the association's full support. ""An MP telling the truth is always unusual. I think it's an endearing quality, to be honest. People will like that, won't they?"" he said. Regarding those criticising the MP, Mr Borrett said: ""Maybe they're not supporters of the Conservatives."" In a blog post, Mr Freeman wrote: ""My mortgage rises this month from £800pcm to £2,000, which I simply couldn't afford to pay on a ministerial salary."" Callers to radio phone-ins, those commenting online and in Mr Freeman's constituency had little sympathy. Hannah Hirst, who lives in Watton and is represented by Mr Freeman, posted: ""Boohoo poor Mr Freeman.. such a hard life he leads isn't it.. maybe he should stop spending on other luxury items he has failed to mention? ""Absolute joke.. least he admits the Tories ain't got a chance in election."" Katt Chilvers, 36, lives in Dereham and like Mr Freeman, her mortgage is also rising from £800 to £2,000 per month. But, she said, she and her husband earn nothing like Mr Freeman did. ""I've got to do it on a not six-figure salary. If he's struggling, what's he doing?"" she asked. ""Me and my husband both work full-time and have to juggle childcare costs along with the cost of living."" She advised her MP to ""downsize, get a smaller place"". Retired teacher Nick Tarrant, also of Watton, said: ""He just quit £118,000 as science minister. After tax etc only leaves him with £72,000. ""New mortgage of £2,000 only leaves him with £48,000 to live on, poor dear. Is there anywhere we can donate to support him?"" Jamie Langham, manager of a butcher shop in Dereham, said: ""Sounds like he needs a new mortgage adviser. ""There's no sympathy there. You should be able to live on £118,000. Maybe downsize your house?"" A caller to Nicky Campbell's BBC 5 Live show, Sarah, of Kendal, Cumbria, said: ""I was outraged. My children and myself, our combined income is less than George Freeman's. ""Their mortgages have all gone up at the back of last year. They are managing to pay it, with difficulty. ""They're making cuts elsewhere to pay for their mortgages and I just wonder how the rest of us are going to live if Mr Freeman can't manage."" Tim Roberts, Eastern regional secretary of trade union Unison, said: ""Norfolk's public service workers will be busy looking for the tiniest violin available to play George Freeman out of office. ""He makes four times more than care staff in his constituency and three times more than the nurses and social workers whose wages his party has been dogmatically holding down. ""If he's struggling with the disastrous effects of Tory economic policies, he should try to imagine how the rest of us are coping after 14 years of real-terms wage cuts and an all-out assault on the public services that could have been there to help pick up the pieces. ""Voters in Mid Norfolk will now be stuck with a part-time MP more interested in topping up his pay packet than looking after their interests."" Some, however, had more sympathy for the MP's position. Posting on Facebook, John Edwards said: ""UK MPs are the lowest paid in Europe. Pay peanuts, get monkeys."" James Hyde posted: ""So many clearly have no clue how this works. His mortgage would be based on his income like everyone else. Cost of living goes up for EVERYONE not just a few."" Mr Freeman, 56, has been a Norfolk MP since 2010, and held ministerial posts in successive Conservative governments, receiving severance payments after departing. He resigned as a minister amid Rishi Sunak's recent cabinet reshuffle and explained in his blog: ""We're in danger of making politics something only hedge fund donors, young spin doctors and failed trade unionists can afford to do."" Mr Freeman, who spent more than a decade in the life sciences and technology sectors before entering Parliament, will be now able to make more money outside of government. On top of his MP's salary of £86,584, he is free to take on second jobs, subject to approval by anti-corruption watchdog the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. The UK annual median wage for full-time workers is £34,963. Many homeowners like, Mr Freeman, are facing steep increases in monthly mortgage payments as they come off fixed-rate deals. It comes after mortgage rates soared and the value of the pound tumbled in the wake of Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. They had already been on the rise after a string of rate hikes by the Bank of England to curb inflation. The politician, who has a 23,000 majority, said he planned to stand for re-election at the general election this year, but said: ""It looks very likely that we're going to have a Labour government."" The BBC asked Mr Freeman if he wished to respond to the public's comments, but he declined to do so. No 10 said it had ""no plans to change our approach to ministerial pay"". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""It's right that we ensure that ministerial pay reflects the wider fiscal situation."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68052806,"This video can not be played Watch: What’s at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire? With Ron DeSantis suspending his presidential campaign on Sunday, Nikki Haley gets the one-on-one match-up with Donald Trump for which she's been longing. ""At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running,"" she says in an email fundraising pitch, sent out shortly after the DeSantis news broke. ""But today, it's officially a two-person race between me and Donald Trump!"" Ms Haley's showdown with Mr Trump in the state-by-state contest to choose a Republican presidential candidate may not turn out exactly as she hoped, however. The way the 14-person field has thinned of late has played out mostly to the former president's advantage. First, Mr DeSantis edged ahead of Ms Haley for second place in Iowa's caucuses, denying her any substantial momentum boost heading into New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday. The day after Mr Trump's huge win in Iowa, another presidential rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, withdrew from the race and endorsed Mr Trump, giving him an extra round of headlines. Now Mr DeSantis is out of the picture, as well. Like Mr Ramaswamy, he has endorsed Mr Trump, although with a bit less fervour. The Florida governor reserved most of his passion for Ms Haley - and not in a good way. He called the former US ambassador to the UN part of ""the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism"". It was a line of attack - Haley the elite-loving globalist - that has been the centrepiece of Mr Trump's attack on his former Cabinet member over the past few days. It took six days for the DeSantis campaign to churn through the stages of political grief and arrive at acceptance. But his decision to back out when he did, and the way he did, might have helped sealed Mr Trump's victory. This video can not be played Watch: Highs and lows of Ron DeSantis's presidential bid Most public-opinion surveys indicate that a clear majority of voters who support Mr DeSantis view Mr Trump as the next best option, suggesting that his withdrawal will end up being a boon to the former president. A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released earlier on Sunday, for instance, found 62% of those in the state who backed Mr DeSantis named Mr Trump as their second choice, while only 30% named Ms Haley. Those aren't great numbers for the former South Carolina governor who has been focusing on New Hampshire for months as the place she believes will give her campaign the boost necessary to seriously challenge Mr Trump. In theory, her strategy was sound. The state's Republican primary is open to independent voters as well as members of the party, allowing moderates who may not like Mr Trump's brand of conservative populism to have a say. The state also has a higher number of college graduates in its population, 37%, which is one of Ms Haley's strongest demographics. She's seen her support rise in the state over recent months, as she's become the clear alternative for those who don't favour the former president. There's little doubt she brings the people skills that DeSantis lacked and has also chosen a different path to the former Florida governor, who positioned himself to the right of Mr Trump. In policy and tone, her campaign has been described as something of a throwback to a pre-Trump era in the Republican Party. There is more compromise in her message and she has largely stayed away from grievance politics and conspiracy theories. And she supports continuing US funding of the Ukraine war. But not being Trump and delivering a more moderate message may not be enough. If she fails to beat him in New Hampshire, it is difficult to see where she might prevail - even in her South Carolina home, where the former president is immensely popular and has the support of almost every other state Republican official. The lament among anti-Trump Republicans has always been that a majority in the party didn't want to see him as the nominee again, but the field against him was simply too divided. If they could only unite behind one candidate, the argument went, victory would be within reach. In New Hampshire, on Tuesday, that theory will finally be put to the test.

This time last year, Republicans were reeling from a poorer-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterm elections; many questioned, again, whether it was time to move on from their two-time Presidential standard-bearer. But Donald Trump is so far ahead in the polls that it would be shocking if he did not clinch the Iowa caucuses. The New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells and Robert Samuels have seen on the ground how much staying power the former President has despite some opposition from religious leaders and establishment power brokers. For MAGA voters, “The core of it is, ‘If Donald Trump is President, I can do anything I want to do,’ ” Samuels tells David Remnick. “ ‘I won’t have anyone . . . telling me I’m wrong all the time.’ ” Since 2016, Trump has honed and capitalized on a message of revenge for voters who feel a sense of aggrievement. Among evangelical voters, Wallace-Wells notes, Trump seems like a bulwark against what they fear is the waning of their influence. “To them, [Biden] is the head of something aggressive and dangerous,” he says. Susan B. Glasser, who writes a weekly column on Washington politics, takes the long view, raising concerns that we’re all a little too apathetic about the threats Trump’s reëlection would pose. “What if 2024 is actually the best year of the next coming years? What if things get much much worse?” she says. “Now is the time to think in a very concrete and specific way about how a Trump victory would have a specific effect not just on policy but on individual lives.” What successful entrepreneurs have in common.

Manhattan Democratic Party Leader Keith Wright's voice was cloned in a nefarious use of AI-generated audio. | Rob Kim/Getty Images By Jeff Coltin 01/31/2024 11:54 AM EST Link Copied NEW YORK — A Manhattan Democratic Party boss let loose in a profanity-laced tirade against a sitting elected official. “I dug her grave and she rolled into it,” Keith Wright, a fixture in New York politics, could be heard saying. Punctured by profanities, he described a rival as “lazy, incompetent — if it wasn’t for her, I’d be in Congress.” The 10-second clip spread quickly among Harlem political players — a seemingly stunning hot mic moment for the influential leader. But there was a problem: It was faked. The audio was generated by artificial intelligence to sound like Wright, and shared anonymously to cause political chaos. Wright quickly denounced it. The episode, 
first reported by POLITICO, marks one of the latest and most egregious uses of deepfake audio yet in the 2024 election year, and it serves to expose the growing use of AI as a nefarious tool in American politics. The incident also alarmed law enforcement officials and AI experts, who warned it forebodes the dissemination of misinformation in elections across the country in coming months and years. And there’s little the nation can do about it. “The regulatory landscape is wholly insufficient,” Ilya Mouzykantskii, who co-founded tech startup Civox, which uses AI-generated calls to reach voters, told POLITICO. “This will be the dominant tech story of this election year.” The faked Wright audio marked the first instance POLITICO could identify of AI-generated content being used against a political opponent in New York, coming on the heels of a 
manipulated Joe Biden robocall ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The art of persuasion and trickery are nothing new in politics. From the famed Watergate scandal of the Nixon White House, to the “Swiftboat” attacks against John Kerry’s 2004 presidential bid, to 
Russian interference the 2016 election of Donald Trump, incendiary tactics have long been a part of American elections. And they are not reserved for White House occupants and hopefuls — 
hyper-local races, too, have been marked by misinformation. Now those forms of manipulation — from the customary to the epic — are being eclipsed by the availability of AI technology that’s credible enough to easily mislead or misinform the public. And it’s happening at a time when disinformation is prevalent and trust in traditional media is dwindling. While big states including 
California and Texas have passed bills addressing malicious uses of deepfakes in politics, New York and most other states are just starting to confront the issue. “There’s a scalability to it that is terrifying,” said Mike Nellis, a political consultant with Authentic Campaigns that’s using generative AI to write candidates’ fundraising emails. Faked audio in New York politics may not have made it into the headlines yet, Nellis said, but “I’m certain that in smaller circles, things like this have been happening.” A robocall 
impersonating Biden in January told people 
not to vote in the New Hampshire primary, and Democratic challenger Dean Phillips’ campaign was blocked by the AI platform OpenAI for using its technology 
to create an audio chatbot with the candidate’s voice. AI wasn’t being used to hurt an opponent in that case, but to aid a politician. Mayor Eric Adams did something similar in 2023, creating 
AI generated audio of his own voice to make public service announcements in languages he doesn’t speak, like Spanish and Yiddish. Regulation is limited across the country. A House bill introduced by Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) has 
no momentum. Three states 
enacted laws on political deepfakes in 2023, NBC News reported, and more than a dozen states have relevant bills introduced. In New York, the Political Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer, or 
PAID Act, would require campaigns to say when they use AI in communications like radio ads or mailers. The Wright audio was “yet another example of why we need to regulate deepfakes in campaigns,” Democratic state Assemblymember Alex Bores, the lead sponsor of the bill, 
posted on X. “It’s (past) time to take this threat seriously.” The issue is 
popular among voters, and has bipartisan support — Republican state Sen. Jake Ashby carries 
almost identical legislation in the other chamber — but the bills only cover a small portion of the potential use of AI. The voice cloning of Wright was created anonymously and wasn’t tied to a specific campaign, so the PAID Act wouldn’t apply. “This is a first step,” Bores said in an interview. “I don’t think this is the last thing we need to do about this, but we need to start with disclosure, and the already most-regulated entities, which are campaigns.” At least a dozen more bills introduced in the New York state legislature deal with regulating the use of AI, but most have to do with commercial uses of the technology, rather than politics. One would 
block films from getting a tax credit if the production used AI to displace human jobs. Gov. Kathy Hochul has said AI is a priority of hers this year, but is focused on cultivating the economic benefits. New York does have at least one law dealing with deepfakes on the books, though. Legislation criminalizing the sharing of sexually explicit images without consent was updated in 2023 to make sure 
AI-generated images were covered too. Congress Congress confronts security risks as it seeks to expand Hill’s AI use By

January 30, 2024 04:53 PM And in the New York City Council, a nonbinding resolution has been introduced urging the Federal Elections Commission 
to take action against deceptive deepfakes in political communications ahead of the 2024 election. The FEC 
has been reviewing the issue, and promises to make rules “
by early summer,” the Washington Post reported. That would come amid the 2024 presidential election year — and in New York City, the police department is already thinking a lot about AI and its public safety implications, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner said. “The specter of the election is galvanizing all sorts of threats. And the technology overlay just complicates everything,” Weiner said in an interview. And of course, the NYPD’s actions are limited by the right to free speech. “It’s not inherently illegal to create disinformation,” she said. The ability for the NYPD to arrest anyone for deepfakes “would really depend on what the content is and how it’s being used.” That could mean using AI-generated content in propaganda for terrorist organizations or simply violating tech companies’ terms of service around use of AI. As AI-generated audio becomes more commonplace, it will bring all clips into question — even real ones. “This whole issue of plausible deniability is actually one of the biggest problems with this technology,” Nitin Verma, a post-doctoral fellow researching AI with the New York Academy of Sciences, told POLITICO. “Anybody who wants to shed any charges, they have a target to point to: this is not me, this is AI.” That could be the case with 
recently reported audio of former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone allegedly saying he’d like to see Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) or Jerry Nadler (D–N.Y.) dead. Stone, a notorious political trickster, has said the clip was faked and AI-generated. Some political players have been 
warning about deepfakes for years. But as the technology becomes mainstream, its quality is rapidly improving. “They’re 90 percent of the way there to ultra-realistic. … If you asked me a year ago, I would say we’re 50 percent of the way there,” said Mouzykantskii. Experts and online tools can usually tell when audio is generated, but you can’t be entirely sure, said Mouzykantskii, “unless you sat there and watched his voice exit his mouth. That’s the way to verify.” CORRECTION: This report has been updated to reflect Ilya Mouzykantskii’s correct title.

https://time.com/6555154/trumps-iowa-campaign-is-relying-on-maga-surrogates/,"In the final days before the Iowa caucuses next Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley are both embarking on a tried-and-true tactic: Barnstorming the state to meet and win over as many voters as possible. Donald Trump? Not so much. While the former President recently participated in a Fox News Town Hall in Des Moines and plans to hold four virtual rallies over the weekend, it has fallen on MAGA World surrogates to engage in the kind of one-on-one voter interactions that are the lifeblood of Iowa politics. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Eric Trump all visited the Hawkeye State last week. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Donald Trump, Jr. each held events on Thursday where they kibitzed with voters and took selfies with fans. Arizona Senate candidate and Iowa native Kari Lake came to Des Moines on Friday to mobilize her fellow America First adherents. And 14 prominent MAGA Republicans—including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz—are holding a meet-and-greet with voters on Monday. The brigade of Trump disciples are key to the former President’s Iowa ground game and show how Trump’s starpower has elevated him beyond mundane retail politics. They may also be a sign of how he plans to campaign over the coming year when he’s bogged down in four separate criminal cases against him. That was the scenario on Thursday, when Trump was in a New York courtroom for the closing arguments of a $370 million civil fraud trial and he unleashed a barrage of attacks against the judge presiding over the case. “This is a fraud on me,” Trump said. More than 1,000 miles across the country, Trump’s on-the-ground campaigning was outsourced to proxies. Carson attended a faith event outside Cedar Rapids, and Trump's eldest son revved up an Urbandale crowd with punchlines and provocations. That same day, DeSantis held five events in Iowa and Haley had two. It was a microcosm of a larger trend in the campaign cycle. Trump has held 25 events in Iowa since announcing his campaign in January 2023. During that same time period, DeSantis has held 136 and Haley 75, according to a Des Moines Register tracker. “Trump has always played by a different set of rules,” says David Kochel, a veteran of Iowa Republican campaigns. “DeSantis goes to 99 counties. Trump goes to six counties, but people show up from 99 counties because they come from all over the place. DeSantis has to go to them. For Trump, they come to him.” DeSantis has roughly a dozen campaign events scheduled statewide from Saturday until caucusing begins Monday night. Haley has eight. After a snowstorm hit the midwestern state overnight Friday, with wind chills below zero, Haley turned her three scheduled town halls that day into Zoom gatherings. The wintry weather has impacted all comers. Trump was planning on holding large in-person rallies over the weekend, but will now have them online. Retail politics have always played an outsize role in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation nominating contest that has the power to shrink the field and reshape the contours of the race. Given Iowa’s small population and the nature of conducting caucuses instead of voters casting traditional ballots, it’s a state that rewards politicians with an endearing personal touch. And it often means that candidates have a chance to meet many of the individual voters who will decide their fate. Hence the old joke about the Iowa voter who's asked whether they will support a candidate: “I don’t know,” they say. “I only met them four or five times.” DeSantis and Haley are going into overdrive to cover as much state territory as they can. The two are currently locked in a battle for second place. The current FiveThirtyEight average of polling has Trump with 51% of the vote, and Haley and DeSantis neck and neck: 17% to 16%. The aim for each campaign in Iowa is to have a convincing enough second place finish that they cement their status as Trump’s only obstacle to the nomination. That way, they surmise, they can consolidate enough Republicans in the coming months to put an end to Trump’s reign of the GOP. DeSantis may have the most at stake in Iowa. He has wagered his primary strategy on winning the Hawkeye State and is polling poorly in the upcoming primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina. “The delta between him and Trump needs to be smaller than the delta between him and Haley,” says Kochel. According to Steve Deace, the popular right-wing radio talk show host who endorsed DeSantis and campaigned with him Thursday night, the Florida governor needs to show that he’s “the clear alternative to Donald Trump in the race.” For the Trump campaign, the objective is to have such a dominant win that it deprives either DeSantis or Haley of the oxygen for a sustained challenge. Trump campaign officials tell TIME they hope to beat the record for the largest margin of victory in Iowa caucus history—13 points—set by Bob Dole in 1988. At the heart of Trump's Iowa effort is to ensure that his loyal base turns out for him during what is expected to be one of the coldest nights in Iowa caucus history. Trump’s team has been pursuing that endgame through a one-two-punch of having Trump hold large rallies while his surrogates—many of whom have risen in popularity through the conservative media ecosystem that Trump helped to create—meet with voters at smaller, more intimate gatherings. For some, it’s working. Philip Hansen, 77, says he’s seen Trump before but appreciated the opportunity to listen to Trump Jr. at an Urbandale restaurant on Thursday. “I’ve never seen Donald Trump’s son before,” the retired open road trucker says. “This is the first time I get to see him.” Hansen says he caucused for Trump in 2016 and plans to do so again on Monday night.

DeSantis and Haley are in a tight race for second place, hoping to become Trump's main challenger for the nomination.

Despite the cold weather, enthusiasm among Trump supporters remains high as they prepare for caucus night."

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lloyd-austin-hospitalization-secrecy-john-kirby-white-house_n_65a51095e4b06444b22391ba,"Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been released from Walter Reed Medical Center after weeks of backlash over his decision to keep his hospitalization a secret ― even from the commander in chief. The Pentagon said that Austin was released Monday after consultation with the medical staff, as first reported by The Associated Press. On the advice of his doctors, Austin will perform his duties remotely before he’s ready to return full-time to the Pentagon, and he has full access to the required secure communications capabilities. The Pentagon chief, 70, was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent a prostatectomy procedure on Dec. 22. He was admitted to Walter Reed’s intensive care unit on Jan. 1 after experiencing complications from the surgery. “Secretary Austin progressed well throughout his stay and his strength is rebounding,” Drs. John Maddox and Gregory Chesnut said in a statement. “He underwent a series of medical tests and evaluations and received non-surgical care during his stay to address his medical needs, to include resolving some lingering leg pains.” “He was discharged home with planned physical therapy and a regular follow up. The Secretary is expected to make a full recovery,” the doctors continued, describing Austin’s cancer prognosis as “excellent.” The decision to keep Austin’s hospitalization a secret for several days, even from President Joe Biden, raised an issue, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said earlier Sunday. Biden, who only learned of Austin’s hospitalization on Jan. 4, acknowledged that the way the incident was handled showed a lapse in judgment, but he told reporters on Friday that he still stood by Austin. Kirby said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Austin was working from his hospital room and has taken part in discussions concerning his department ― including the decision to strike Houthi militia in Yemen in coordination with the British, in another escalation of tensions in the Middle East amid Israel’s war in Gaza. Austin is “actively involved and engaged,” Kirby said. “And I think it’s important for people to remember that the Cabinet officials don’t have to sit and talk every single day to make every decision. A lot of the work that gets done in national security is done at the staff level.” But Kirby conceded that the initial decision to keep the White House in the dark was an issue. “That’s a problem,” he said. “And the president has spoken to that. That is not the way it’s supposed to be. It’s certainly something we need to get more answers to.” Robert Storch, the Pentagon’s inspector general, on Thursday announced an investigation to review whether the department’s “policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications, and the effective transition of authorities, as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.” Austin’s office and the White House have also ordered separate probes. While the incident raised eyebrows in Washington, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who sits on the armed services committee, said Sunday that he believes Austin should stay in his post, even as he acknowledged there was clearly “a breakdown” in the chain of command. “His health and well-being is what I’m most concerned about, and his dedication to our country,” Manchin told CBS’ Margaret Brennan. “I think we owe something to make sure we have the facts before we put politics. Politics is always going to ask, though, for someone’s head, always does. And this toxic atmosphere is what people don’t like anymore.” On if there was a breakdown in the chain of command in alerting the White House about Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin’s hospitalization, @Sen_JoeManchin says “there has definitely been a breakdown,” adding that members of Congress will receive a briefing on the matter this week. pic.twitter.com/J2uovXY95y At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

https://dnyuz.com/2024/02/03/fox-news-suddenly-wants-celebrities-out-of-politics-well-one-celebrity/,"Taylor Swift, you may have noticed, is everywhere: packing arenas on the Eras tour; filling theaters with her concert film; popping onto your TV screen from a luxury suite at Kansas City Chiefs games, cheering on her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. And now she’s living rent-free in Fox News hosts’ heads. After reports that the Biden re-election campaign was angling for an endorsement from the superstar (who backed President Biden in 2020), commentators on the network strapped on their culture-war helmets. “Don’t get involved in politics!” Jeanine Pirro urged her. “We don’t want to see you there!” Another commentator, Charly Arnolt, pleaded, “Please don’t believe everything Taylor Swift says.” Sean Hannity addressed the issue  in prime time: “Maybe she wants to think twice.” Fox’s anxiety attack follows months in which MAGA opinionators have spun baroque conspiracy theories about the power couple: that Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce’s romance was staged; that the N.F.L. was rigging the Super Bowl for the Chiefs; and that it was all an unholy plot to supercharge an eventual Biden endorsement. The Fox host Jesse Watters even flirted with the speculation, floating the idea that Swift’s success was a psyop masterminded by the Defense Department. In retrospect, “Paul is dead” lacked imagination. Of course, people are entitled to their opinions on celebrity political speech or the possible existence of a secret Pentagon diva lab. But if Fox News’s hosts truly believe that it’s irresponsible and dangerous to invite celebrities to weigh in on politics, they might want to turn their attention to … Fox News. Over the years, Fox has invited Gene Simmons, the bassist of Kiss, to talk about the handling of an Ebola outbreak. It had the fashion model Fabio on to blame crime in California on liberalism. It gave us Kid Rock on cancel culture. Last year, the actor Jim Caviezel declared Donald J. Trump “the new Moses” on “Fox & Friends.” And let’s not forget that Fox was instrumental in the entry into politics of a certain TV celebrity, whom you might know better as the candidate Mr. Biden will likely be running against. In March 2011, the network announced a new weekly segment on “Fox & Friends”: “Mondays With Trump.” Every week, the host of NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice,” a frequent network guest for years, would deplore Obama Administration policies and fill in the hosts on why he’d fired the likes of Gary Busey and LaToya Jackson on that week’s episode. Through his birtherism crusade, through his tweeting that Mr. Obama’s 2012 victory over Mitt Romney was “a total sham and a travesty,” Mr. Trump’s attachment with Fox and its audience only grew deeper. Mr. Trump did not appeal to the Fox viewership in spite of his celebrity; he appealed, at least in part, because of his celebrity. For years, they had heard liberal speeches at the Oscars; they had been told, not least by Fox, that Hollywood celebrities disdained their beliefs. Now, here was a genuine prime-time network celebrity who spoke their language and was on their side. It’s not simply that Fox has welcomed celebrities that aligned with its politics. (Its hosts also tend to speak well of Ronald Reagan, who knew his way around a movie set.) It has done as much as any force to celebritize conservative politics and infuse them with entertainment values. Fox, from its earliest days under the talk-show producer turned political operative Roger Ailes, cultivated a sense of razzle-dazzle. A Fox executive once described “Fox & Friends” as “an entertainment show that does some news”; Glenn Beck, its star of the early Obama era, called his show “the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.” More broadly, Fox has long embraced a kind of pop-politics cultural warfare that made a martyr of Roseanne Barr and a demon of Kathy Griffin, and that encouraged its viewers to question whether their beer was too liberal. Like the right-wing publisher Andrew Breitbart (adapting an idea from the Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci), it believed that politics is downstream from culture. But it has been selective about which celebrities should stay in their lane, and which get to merge. After LeBron James criticized then-President Trump in a 2018 interview, Fox’s Laura Ingraham told him to “shut up and dribble.” The endorsements of Mr. Trump by the former quarterback Brett Favre and the golf champion Jack Nicklaus, for some reason, were unobjectionable. Much of the criticism of Ms. Swift, meanwhile, seems tinged with condescension, suggesting that a 33-year-old female pop star is a gullible naïf, ripe for bamboozling by political operators. “Does Taylor realize the guy that they want her to endorse is a kind of stumbling, bumbling mess?” asked Mr. Hannity, raising a concern he has not voiced when interviewing, say, the right-wing rocker Ted Nugent (“never shy about sharing his opinions!”). Do Fox’s conservatives really have anything to worry about? There’s a good argument that celebrity political endorsements are rarely meaningful. Academic researchers have postulated that Oprah’s blessing was good for a million Obama votes in 2008; then again, in 2018 Ms. Swift endorsed a Democrat in a Tennessee Senate race who lost handily. Since 2020, it’s true that her fame level has risen from “star” to “molten cosmic supercluster from which galaxies are born.” Still, it’s only a guess that her clout might translate into votes. Another celebrity principle may apply here, however: The Streisand Effect. Just as Barbra Streisand’s attempt to suppress photos of her home only drew more attention to them, Fox’s opposition could magnify any Swift endorsement. It could even create blowback if it manages to turn the perception of the story into the G.O.P. vs. the Swifties, conservative scolds against a wildly popular millennial woman, Red America vs. “Red (Taylor’s Version)” America. But bashing celebrities, warring over culture and playing into the fear of cultural marginalization may be too deeply wired into Fox’s sensibility for the network to do otherwise. As Ms. Swift might sing: Look what they made themselves do. The post  Fox News Suddenly Wants Celebrities Out of Politics. Well, One Celebrity.  appeared first on New York Times.  Copyright © 2023. Copyright © 2023.",politics,relevant,"The article discusses how Fox News hosts have criticized Taylor Swift for potentially endorsing President Biden for reelection, despite the network's history of welcoming celebrities with conservative viewpoints. It highlights how Fox News has played a role in celebritizing conservative politics and infusing them with entertainment values, while also being selective about which celebrities should stay out of politics. The article questions the sincerity of Fox News's concern about celebrities in politics and suggests that their opposition to Swift's potential endorsement could backfire and create a backlash. It concludes by noting that Fox News's approach to bashing celebrities and warring over culture may be too ingrained for the network to change its stance."

hide caption Taiwan's President-elect Lai Ching-te attends a press conference outside the headquarters of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taipei on Saturday. The election on Saturday of Taiwan's vice president and candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Lai Ching-te, to be the island's next leader highlights Taiwanese voters' support for political continuity, but may add fresh uncertainty into already frosty relations with China. Beijing considers the self-governed island a part of China, and hopes to ""reunify"" it with the mainland eventually. Lai, also known as William Lai, previously called himself a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence,"" but had moderated his messaging on the campaign trail and pledged support for the status quo. Beijing, however, painted the election in stark terms, calling him a ""separatist"" and ""troublemaker."" Lai's vice president-elect, Hsiao Bi-khim, is on Beijing's sanctions list. With Lai's win, tensions seem poised to rise. But analysts don't think Beijing wants to provoke a war at this point, and will carefully process early signals from the newly elected Lai. ""I think we're in a wait-and-see [mode],"" said Margaret Lewis, a professor of law at Seton Hall University, who was in Taiwan to watch the process. Shortly after Lai's victory speech on Saturday night, the Chinese government's Taiwan Affairs Office issued a statement. ""Our stance on resolving the Taiwan question and realizing national reunification remains consistent, and our determination is as firm as rock,"" it said. A post shared by NPR (@npr) And on Sunday, Beijing criticized U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken for congratulating Lai on his victory, saying the U.S. statement ""sends a gravely wrong signal to the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces"" and goes against Washington's commitment to maintaining only unofficial ties with Taiwan. Lai took 40% of the vote, with others in the three-way competition snagging significant percentages and Lai's party losing control of parliament. Still, Lewis noted that on China policy, the amount of daylight between Lai and his main rival, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang Party (KMT), was limited, highlighting where public opinion in Taiwan stands. ""It's not like this was a stark black or white choice between two sharply divergent views of how to handle cross-strait affairs,"" she said, referring to the Taiwan Strait that geographically separates the island from mainland China. Lai favors less reliance on China, while Hou and the KMT want more engagement. According to the official tally, Lai's more than 5 million votes fell short of the over 8 million that his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, won in the island's last elections in 2020. The KMT garnered more than 3.9 million votes while the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) took about 3.1 million. In parliament, the KMT snagged 52 seats, while Lai's DPP only took 51 and the TPP grabbed 8. Analysts say that outcome will likely constrain Lai's ability to govern. Beijing has taken note, with the Taiwan Affairs Office saying the results ""reveal that the Democratic Progressive Party cannot represent the mainstream public opinion on the island.""

China has vowed to control Taiwan one day. When the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, China's ruling Communist Party severed formal dialogue and has since significantly ramped up military saber rattling around the island. Beijing had hoped to avert a Lai victory through a pressure campaign that labeled him a dangerous advocate of Taiwan independence — a red line for China. It had also called the election a choice between war and peace. Now, it must deal with the outcome, at a time when it may not be in the mainland's interests to have an armed conflict, according to Zhao Minghao, a professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. China has ""very significant economic challenges and I don't think that they are ready [to use] any military options to resolve this issue,"" he said. But he added: ""If Beijing does nothing, it's unacceptable domestically, because the Taiwan issue is so important ... in terms of China's politics. And Chinese people, they would expect the government to do something to show that we are firm, very confident in managing the situation."" In his acceptance speech, Lai seemed to signal his intention to continue the status quo, saying that he would act ""in accordance with the constitutional order of the Republic of China,"" referring to Taiwan's official name. He also pledged to use dialogue, not confrontation. But he emphasized the principle of ""dignity and parity.""

hide caption Supporters of Lai Ching-te react after Lai won the presidential election outside the party's headquarters in Taipei on Saturday. The big concern — and a reason why the continuity vote is a problem for Beijing — is that the number of people in Taiwan who identify as Chinese is shrinking, according to multiple polls in recent years. Fewer voters in Taiwan view China as trustworthy. At the same time, Zhao said, many in China worry that U.S. policy toward Taiwan is shifting, and the chances of ""reunification"" by peaceful means are further waning as a result. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" is inevitable, and that the problem cannot be passed from generation to generation. Lai's election represents a rebuke, of sorts. It's an unprecedented third consecutive term for the DPP, which got its start in the 1980s by activists and lawyers seeking formal independence for Taiwan. The party now stands for a distinct Taiwan identity. What's next is anybody's guess. Beijing seems likely to continue to shun exchanges with the DPP-led government of Taiwan, according to Gabriel Wildau, an analyst at the consultancy Teneo. ""Still, by signaling the durability of the DPP's hold on the electorate, the election outcome may force mainland leaders to reconsider their policy of complete freezeout,"" Wildau wrote in a note. He said that may lead to ""lower-profile exchanges"" between the two sides. Alternatively, things could go the opposite way, according to Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""Beijing could intensify its cocktail of political, military, and economic leverage against the Lai administration while courting the opposition, which will further complicate Taiwanese domestic politics and intensify tensions between Beijing and Taipei, but also destabilize the Indo-Pacific security environment,"" he wrote.

The election comes against a backdrop of friction between China and the United States, although both have been trying to lower tensions in recent months. The Biden administration is sending a delegation of former officials to Taiwan following the election, in a move that a senior administration official earlier this past week said was standard. At the same time, the administration also pledged to maintain dialogue with Beijing. But where U.S. policy on Taiwan heads after the U.S. presidential election in November remains a question mark.

http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dean-phillips-ads-tech-super-pac-sam-altman-1234942841/,"A super PAC  with ties to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is lavishing money on some embarrassingly bad ads supporting President Joe Biden’s long-shot challenger, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.). According to disclosures, We Deserve Better, launched last year, has spent $665,000 so far boosting Phillips, including $154,000 on TV ads. Phillips, a late entry into the presidential race, is pouring his energy into New Hampshire, operating on the theory that a triumph in the first-in-the nation primary, where Biden will not appear on the ballot, could catapult his candidacy to national relevance. Winning the state won’t necessarily help the Minnesota congressman and liquor heir with the nomination math: The Democratic National Committee stripped New Hampshire of its delegates for its refusal to heed a party order to move its primary later in the calendar, behind South Carolina’s contest. Nevertheless, We Deserve Better is now up on the air in New Hampshire with TV ads touting Phillips candidacy. The super PAC was launched in November, shortly after Puck News reported that Phillips met with Altman at the tech mogul’s home in San Francisco. A few days prior to that meeting, Biden signed an executive order imposing new reporting requirements for companies working on artificial intelligence technology, including a demand that “developers of the most powerful AI systems share their safety test results and other critical information with the U.S. government.” We Deserve Better is being led by Matt Krisiloff, an early employee at OpenAI who reportedly dated Altman. His brother Scott, an executive at a nuclear fusion startup backed by Altman, is on the super PAC’s board of directors, according to ad buying records. The group is registered at a San Francisco property owned by Amit Shanbhag, founder of the data brokerage RocketReach.com. (Shanbhag said the house is being rented and declined to provide the names of the current tenants.) We Deserve Better has not yet disclosed its donors, and it is unclear if Altman himself is among them.

					Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term The group is one of two super PACs that have supported Phillips, an outspoken critic of the corrupting influence of big money on politics. The other super PAC, Pass the Torch USA, was formed by former top John McCain aide Steve Schmidt, who helped launch Phillips’ campaign. That group has reported spending roughly $460,000 to boost Phillips’ candidacy so far. Justin Phillips (no apparent relation) is listed as the treasurer for both We Deserve Better and Pass the Torch; he did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dean Phillips has sharply criticized the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which paved the way for super PACs that can raise unlimited donations to spend on elections. In November, he said the ruling was “one of the most abhorrent decisions in Supreme Court history since Dred Scott,” calling it “sickening” and saying it “turned over the keys to Congress and to our government to the wealthy and well-connected.” Jeff Weaver, Phillips’ campaign manager, echoed that sentiment when reached for comment about the super PACs boosting his candidacy in New Hampshire, but he didn’t reject their support. “The fact that our politicians follow dollars, instead of voters, is abhorrent,” Weaver said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “That’s why Dean is one of the only members of Congress who has rejected all PAC money and who doesn’t have a leadership PAC. If President Biden denounces the two PACs working on his behalf in New Hampshire, and stops weaponizing his DNC to illegally suppress voters, then we would follow suit. As it stands, Biden is personally boycotting New Hampshire, but there are two PACs working hard to convince New Hampshire voters to write him in when he’s written them off.”

					The Polling ‘Disaster’ That’s Starting To Terrify Team Trump There’s a distinct “How do you do, fellow kids!” vibe to We Deserve Better’s digital spots, like the cringeworthy “Dean ‘Handsome’ Phillips” ad, featuring a series of Phillips thirst traps from days of yore set to Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin’s “I Like It.” Another awkward bit features a man having a stilted, TikTok-style conversation with himself about Phillips’ platform. Several of the We Deserve Better ads advance dubious claims. In one ad paid for by the super PAC, a male narrator declares Phillips is “the only candidate in the House or Senate who accepts no lobbyist money and no PAC money.” In addition to being rich with irony, appearing as it does in a super PAC-produced ad, the claim isn’t true: More than 70 lawmakers elected in 2022 refused donations from corporate political action committees, and Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) has publicly sworn off both PAC and lobbyist cash in her Senate race. In a reproductive rights-focused ad, a female narrator raises questions about Biden’s ability to protect abortion rights. Biden “had the House, Senate and presidency, but 1. Didn’t codify Roe v. Wade. 2. Didn’t safeguard access to Plan C. 3. Didn’t restrict the Supreme Court’s authority to rule on abortion.” Biden has repeatedly pledged to codify Roe, but has never had the filibuster-proof Senate majority he would have required to do so. (A Democratic proposal to codify the court decision failed to win even a simple majority in 2022.) It’s unclear if the PAC ad is referring to Plan B, the morning-after pill, which is still legal in all 50 states, or the nonprofit organization Plan C, whose website offers information about how to obtain abortion pills; and while Congress has the power to enact laws that govern how the Supreme Court operates, such an effort would have undoubtedly run into the filibuster — a Senate rule requiring 60 votes for most legislation that Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) refused to reform. (The Biden campaign declined to comment on the ads from the pro-Phillips super PAC.) A separate health care-focused spot asserts “Dean Phillips supports Medicare for All, which would provide universal health coverage for all Americans.” Phillips, who has not previously supported the Medicare for All legislation during three terms in Congress, endorsed the bill last month. He is still not publicly listed as a co-sponsor of the legislation. Before announcing his support for Medicare for All, Phillips pitched the idea of a national health insurance plan with “a capitated model.” A capitated payment model typically means giving a company — like health insurers that operate private Medicare Advantage plans — a set amount of money each month to provide coverage for an enrollee. It’s well-understood that this model gives firms a financial incentive to deny care: Fewer dollars paid out equals more profit.

https://www.vox.com/the-weeds/2024/1/24/24048407/hannah-ritchie-climate-change-optimism-book-action-interview,"Filed under: Don’t let climate doom win. It’s no secret that the environmental health of the planet is in dire straits right now. The Earth was its hottest in recorded history in 2023. Our winters are shorter, our summers hotter, and our natural disasters more extreme. The doom and gloom around climate change is understandable when you take it all into account. Global governments struggled to stay under the goal of 1.5 Celsius temperature increase last year, meaning we could be barreling toward even worse outcomes. There’s a sense of existential dread, a feeling that we’ve gone too far and that there’s no stopping the inevitable demise of Earth and all the creatures that inhabit it, including us. But one expert says it doesn’t have to be that way. Hannah Ritchie — deputy editor at Our World in Data — argues that climate “doomerism” leads people astray from meaningful action. In her debut book, Not the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet, she says we should reframe the way we talk about climate change. Hope, informed by data, can be a helpful tool for mobilizing the masses, who range from climate deniers to the most devoted of environmentalists. “I think tailoring messaging to different audiences is really, really crucial,” the Future Perfect 50 honoree says. “I think some people do actually just respond to the fear or the catastrophic messages. But I think there’s also a big group of people that don’t like that. I’m trying to bridge that ground a little bit and get people that might be on the fence or a bit disengaged to engage a bit more.” In this episode of The Weeds, we sit down with Ritchie to discuss the current state of climate change, why the planet has actually never been “sustainable” for all of human history, and why shifting toward an optimistic (but realistic) narrative can help keep the planet from warming. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to The Weeds on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get podcasts. I want to get into something you spend time in the book discussing, and that’s what you consider ineffective policies like that around plastic straws, for instance. I’m curious why you think it’s ineffective, and also why there’s so much focus on these policies that aren’t maybe the most effective. There are two reasons to counter some of the ineffective stuff. One is that some of this stuff that people think makes a positive difference actually makes a negative difference. We should just call that out. But the other dimension to this is that people often become so overwhelmed with the number of decisions they should be making about environmental stuff. They go through their day questioning every little decision. That can become overwhelming. There are probably like five big decisions that make a big impact on your carbon footprint. Then the rest of the decisions really make very little difference at all, and you can do those if you want. But there’s also this effect, which is called moral licensing, where if you have done a behavior that you think has made a positive difference, often you kind of let other things fall by the wayside. So you might think, “Oh, I used a paper straw at dinner. Therefore, it doesn’t matter that I take the car or I take the flight or I eat the meat because I’ve done my bit because I used a paper straw.” The impact of the paper straw is so incredibly small compared to the other decisions. What are some of those things that we think have a positive impact but actually are not helpful at all? One that comes up a lot is local food. If you ask people, “What’s the best way to reduce the carbon footprint of your diet?” they’ll often say, “Eat local.” The rationale for that makes sense: Transporting stuff obviously emits CO2 emissions, whether on a truck or on a plane or by boat. But the key thing when you break down the data on emissions from food is that what you’re eating matters more than how far it’s traveled to reach you. If you look at the carbon footprint of different foods across the world, the average percentage that the transport part makes up is just 5 percent. Most of the impacts of your food are coming from a land use change, or they’re coming from emissions on the farm. You’ll often hear people say, “My local beef is obviously much lower carbon than your avocados shipped in from a given country.” And actually, that’s just not true. The beef versus the avocados matters much, much more than whether it’s local. There are reasons why someone would want to eat local, and that’s perfectly fine. It’s just not necessarily the best way to reduce your carbon footprint. So if there’s other reasons to eat local, like supporting your local community, then go ahead and do that. What are some of the things we could be doing that are actually helpful? It’s primarily about meat and dairy consumption. That’s probably the biggest part of your footprint there. And then food waste, those are like the two massive ones on food. On energy, it’s largely about travel: walking, cycling, and public transport is best. If you have a car — if you need a car, then an electric car is definitely better than a [gas] car. And then in your home, it’s not necessarily stuff like your lights or plugging your phone charger, [but] often heating and cooking. What’s really effective is an electric heat pump that tends to be much better than a boiler. And then putting in a solar panel on your roof massively reduces your energy footprint. It’s very easy to spiral when you think about the state that the world is in, and I’m wondering how you keep from spiraling. Because it’s very easy to start panicking. It’s understandable why the doom-and-gloom messaging takes over. I’m definitely not saying that you’re going to be okay. It depends on what we do. It’s not like we’re going to have no impact and things are all going to be fine. But the gradient of how okay things will be will depend on our actions. We have this opportunity here to really take strong action. The balance there is really important. You do need to not necessarily panic, but you do need concern and you need a sense of urgency. It’s also important to focus on the solutions. If you just tell people this is a massive problem and leave them with it, what are they supposed to do with that? I often try to highlight signs of progress, and that’s not necessarily to congratulate ourselves about how well we’ve done. But it’s all often about building momentum and showing people this can change. It’s this idea of celebrating small wins so that people don’t feel despondent. You can relate it to even really small personal stuff in your own life, like, say, training for a marathon and you’ve never been a runner. The most demotivating thing ever is if you’ve been training for three months and you’ve made no progress. Then you just stop because you think, “I’ve been doing this for three months. I’m wasting my time. I’m just going to stop.” If you’ve been training for three months, you’re not at the marathon-level standard. And that’s where we are on climate change. But you have gotten fitter over that period of time and you can now run a 10k. It’s about building on that momentum to say, “Okay, if I can build up to 10k, then with more training and with much more effort, then I can get to the marathon distance.” It’s about using momentum to drive more progress rather than just clapping and saying, “That’s kind of where we are.” I think for a lot of people who care about the environment, these small actions matter. It offers a sense of control in a world where so much feels out of our control. These are small steps that we can take without the backing of companies or federal governments. What advice do you have for people who you know want to make a change but aren’t in power or don’t have proximity to power? We often envision this as very top-down, but I think many of the successes on this have come from more community efforts. [Efforts like] building wind power in Texas, for example, have come from small communities saying, “We’re going to build a wind farm for our community.” So often, it can start to come from the grassroots and build up. There’s a lot of that in environmentalism where it’s often pointing fingers, and I think that’s really ineffective at getting people to change. But change in yourself can often be really infectious and people get interested. What do you think the role of optimism is in our climate future? It needs to be balanced with a sense of urgency and the need to act. A lot of people are feeling quite paralyzed at the moment. I think they are, in some sense, disengaging because they feel like we’re making no progress and we probably won’t make any progress. And this is such a critical time. We need to really get moving on this stuff. This is the worst time for people to disengage and look away. So, for me, the role of optimism is to drive people to actually take action.

https://www.theverge.com/24054658/senator-brian-schatz-congress-kosa-first-amendment-regulation-decoder-interview,"By  Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Today, I’m talking with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. He’s been in the Senate for a little more than a decade now, and he’s seen a lot in that time. We joke that Decoder is ultimately a show about org charts, but there’s a lot of truth to it. A CEO can upend their whole company’s org chart if they think it will improve their business, but a member of the federal government — especially a senator — can’t unilaterally ditch the structures that have been woven into the fabric of our country for more than 200 years. That can lead to… some inefficiencies, let’s say, and you’ll hear Schatz talk about the four separate offices he has to balance against each other and the concessions he has to make to work within that structure. As you’d expect, we also talked a lot about what Congress is — and mostly isn’t — doing to regulate tech, despite tech regulation being high on most folk’s agendas. One of the few points that Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on these days is that social media is bad for kids, especially in the wake of the Frances Haugen “Facebook Papers” leak a couple of years back. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! To that end, Schatz is one of the co-sponsors of a controversial piece of legislation called the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, which aims to protect kids from algorithmically amplified harms. The stated goal of the legislation is to reduce anxiety, depression, and related issues, like eating disorders, in teenagers and kids. But there are a lot of bad-faith leaders out there who want to use a bill like this to prevent kids — or adults — from accessing content about their own lives, like resources for LGBTQ+ support or reproductive health. Schatz is also the primary sponsor of a second child safety bill, the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, that would require social media platforms to verify the age of account holders and completely bar children under the age of 13 from signing up. This bill also requires parental consent for teens to create accounts and prohibits platforms from subjecting any minor to an algorithmic recommendation system. Both pieces of legislation ultimately arrive at the same conflict: Any bill regulating speech, or access to speech, is going to run up against the US Constitution. Sen. Schatz and I talked a lot about that tension between good intentions and real outcomes. We also talked a lot about the big stumbling block for passing any laws about content moderation, which is, of course, the First Amendment. We discussed the First Amendment quite a bit. As you are undoubtedly aware, the First Amendment literally says, among other things, “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.” A law like KOSA does exactly that: it abridges the freedom of speech online. The hope is just that saying those regulations protect kids overcomes the inevitable First Amendment challenges. It’s important stuff, and we got pretty deeply into it. And as a bonus, you’ll hear the senator describe how he hypothetically bought beer in high school while underage. One note before we start: you’ll hear us talk about something called strict scrutiny a lot, which is how courts evaluate First Amendment cases. Strict scrutiny is complex but it fundamentally means the government has to show two things in order for a law limiting speech to stand: the law must meet a compelling government interest — in the case of KOSA, the government hopes that protecting children is a compelling government interest — and the law must also be narrowly tailored to meet that goal using the least restrictive means possible. It is honestly anyone’s guess whether a law like KOSA would overcome strict scrutiny in today’s courts, but you’ll hear Schatz explain why he thinks it would. Okay: Senator Brian Schatz. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Senator Brian Schatz, you are a US Senator from Hawaii. You are a Democrat. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I am very excited to talk to you. There is a lot going on in this country, in this world. It’s a long list of questions here, but when I talk to politicians, I often want to just talk about how it works because I feel like that is very hidden away. You’re a senator, you work on a slightly longer timeline. You have six-year terms. It’s an election year. There’s a lot of pressure on the Senate, there’s a lot of pressure on the government. Our government’s not so functional right now. How are you thinking about making decisions in this time, in this moment in American history? Well, I think the first thing is that there are things that the country has to accomplish, and the first among them is an emergency supplemental funding bill for Ukraine, and that is sucking all of the oxygen out of the air. It’s leaving very little room for some of the mundane but important things that we need to do in terms of governance, especially just passing a regular appropriations bill. You’ve got probably more talent in this legislature than in most local legislatures but less functionality. Even local legislatures with regular citizens, without fancy degrees, who are on paper less impressive than my colleagues, still pass a regular appropriations bill. They don’t miss their deadlines. They do something in every category, whether it’s agriculture or transportation or education or health or pensions, and we seem to be at loggerheads over a number of things. I’m trying to help to get this supplemental passed, but underneath that, you have to work your own priorities, and to me, what you want to do is divide that into two categories. One is, “What’s public policy where you can make a difference?” and the other is, “What does your state need?” Of course, in Hawaii, I’m focused not exclusively but primarily on Maui and its recovery, and on the national level, I continue to think in terms of tech policy and climate policy, so that’s kind of how I divide my day, and I think the biggest challenge on a day to day is to try to make sure that your priorities are reflected by your schedule because you can be wandering around going from thing to thing. All of them are important, but they may not reflect how you actually view what’s the most important thing to accomplish in a short period of time or through the year. I like the idea that your priorities are reflected in your schedule. You’re picking and choosing what to do. Obviously, your constituents can see your schedule. They can see what you are talking about and working on. Underneath that, you need to have some sort of team to support you and make sure that your priorities are executed upon or you’re writing legislative language or you’re reading bills. How have you structured your office to make that work? I have basically four separate offices. I’ve got the Hawaii office, I’ve got the DC, what they call a personal office. In the DC personal office, I have a bunch of experts, and we work in pods. We have a climate team, a tech team, a transportation team, a housing team, and so on, and then, I’m also the chair of a committee called T-HUD — Transportation and HUD — and we’re in charge of, essentially, the federal budget as it relates to transportation and housing and urban development. I’m also chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I was actually a nonprofit executive, and I had a nonprofit with a couple hundred employees, and so I think a lot about how organizations are run and ought to run. The challenge for me is that, I think if you came in from the private sector, you’d say, “Wait, why are these four offices sort of semiautonomous?” And the answer is, “Well, that’s the way the Senate is structured.” We try to make sure that it all rhymes and is syncopated, but if this were a private-sector enterprise, I would simply align them and merge them. I’m not really able to do that. Trying to make sure it makes sense is one of the aspects of making sure that you’re as effective as possible because, now, I don’t have seven staff [members], I have probably between 60 and 70 people, and we’ve got to make sure we’re all, as we say in Hawaii, rowing in the same direction. Yeah. Talk to me about the idea that the Senate structure is imposing a structure on you. This is very interesting to me because what you’re describing is divisions, right? In any company, you have a division on tech policy, you do a division on climate policy, and you’re saying that’s kind of imposed on you by the Senate. Yeah. I’m the chair of the Transportation and HUD Committee, and I have staff for that, but they belong to the Appropriations Committee. They report to me, but they belong to another committee. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs is its own thing established by the Senate, and I’m at the helm over there, but they also don’t belong to my personal office. Just administratively, they’re in different places. They’re paid out of different pots, and that’s not something any individual senator has the ability to change, so what you have to do is roll with it and make it work. A buddy of mine calls this every day as moving an amoeba across a bridge. You just try to have to make it work, and politics is... You can sort of plan and plan and plan, but in the end, it becomes a question of improvising and finding the opportunity to get a bill across the finish line. Two things I’ve observed about the Senate is that even the small things are enormous, and so that’s really fun. You can pass bills that don’t make the cable shows or don’t make a podcast but make a real difference in people’s lives. The other thing is that I think not everybody stays focused on what their home state needs. It’s a heady place over here, and you can kind of get sucked into a universe where you’re at the French Embassy, and you’re trying to do Meet the Press in the afternoon, and I think it’s foundational to the job to serve your constituents. I got constituents 5,000 miles away from where I work, and we’re the most isolated populated place on the planet. We really do need federal help, and that’s job one for me. I want to talk about how Congress is working and not working right now. A lot of it feels external, right? The nature of our politics is inherently polarized. Maybe social media is making that worse or maybe it’s not. I think people are listening to the show, saying, “Is there any part of it that’s inherent to the structure here, where you have staffers who are not your staffers, where people can’t innovate on how Congress is actually built in order to be more effective?” I don’t know that it’s a question of that kind of organizational structure, but I think it is fair to say that the Constitution was intentionally vague in certain aspects. As Secretary Madeleine Albright, may she rest in peace, talked about in foreign policy, the Constitution was an invitation to struggle between the Article I and the Article II branch. It was intentionally vague [about] who had command over foreign policy. Obviously, the president is the commander in chief, but who gets to set foreign policy was left unsaid because they wanted that kind of tension. I think if you combine the constitutional design, which is to say that it was intentionally made difficult to pass a federal law, with the current situation and its polarization, it just makes it increasingly difficult. The one thing I’d say that I think maybe your listeners may not be aware of is there’s a lot of stuff that happens underneath that makes a real impact on people’s lives. I’m thinking of [Senator] Dick Durbin and Senator [Roy] Blunt, who’s now retired, [who] quietly decided to increase health research funding by double over a period of time, and they just kind of quietly did it in 15 percent chunks over a seven-year period, and they just got it done. Had they announced it and tried to get on Meet the Press, it might’ve polarized. The bill that I did, actually I keep doing it because there are more iterations to it, but the telehealth transformation was enabled by changes in federal law over the last 11 years, and that has been entirely bipartisan and not at all controversial. I just do want people to understand that they’re sub-rosa, and maybe less interestingly, there are a lot of people doing a lot of important work. I did a little experiment one time back when Facebook was still arguably the most important means to get the message out. Lamar Alexander, who’s a Republican who retired, and I were trying to get more money for ARPA-E, this Department of Energy innovation program, and we went on the floor and had what they call a colloquy. It’s basically like a light exchange of views — but not necessarily too contentious — and talked about increasing funding for this very, very important thing, and then we did it. Then I put it on the internet, and it was like the least clicky thing that I’ve ever put on the internet. All I could have said instead was, like, “Trump’s terrible, resist,” and I would have gotten 10,000 people saying, “Right on, fight the good fight.” The thing you said about the internet, I think it’s more true than anyone wants to admit, is that our incentives are now aligned toward virality. And me just kind of doing my job on a bipartisan basis and improving the people’s lives in some sort of incremental fashion is just not that interesting for Instagram and Twitter anymore. This leads me to a criticism that I think you have made most loudly about your Republican colleagues, most loudly of anyone actually at this point, that bad-faith arguments designed for virality seem to be driving the Republican Party more than ever. I think we can probably point to some specific individuals where that is the most true and some individuals you’ve mentioned maybe that’s less true, but that seems to be the animus of the party. There are certainly members of the Democratic Party who are driven by virality in the same way. How do you stop it? Can you stop it? I don’t know. I mean, if I had the answer I’d be implementing. I think it is extremely challenging, and by the way, it’s not like people wake up and kind of wring their hands and say, “How can I be unserious and just get on the internet?” What happens instead is that you— Oh, I think you have some colleagues who wake up and think that. That’s fair. There are a lot of people who wake up and think, “How can I make sure I get a social media post that performs well, where the metrics are great?” Fair enough, but I think there are also a lot of people who may go to a hearing, may say a thing and then it goes viral, and then you’re accidentally on that slippery slope where the incentives start to align around you behaving in a certain fashion. You have to just really remain conscious of “what’s the job?” which is why I go back to: find out what your home state needs and continue to fight for that. Sometimes I think for some members that sounds less impressive, less historically important, right? Just less attractive. You came to the big show to do big national and international things, and some people forget to think about the fact that their harbor needs repair or their electricity grid needs stabilization or, in the case of Maui, that we need federal funding just to put roofs over people’s heads. That is not going to get anybody marked down as a historical figure, but who cares? The job is to serve your constituents, and you got to do that first. I have a lot of executives and founders on the show who are executives, they make decisions. The decisions are acted on very quickly. They succeed or fail. The market gives them feedback. Off to the next decision, and that feedback loop is very important to all of them. Those folks look at government and they say, “Okay, we’re going to double funding for healthcare by 15 percent over seven years and no one will even notice it until the very end when Brian Schatz comes on Decoder and says it out loud for the first time.” That is a disaster. We can’t work that way. We’re not even going to pay attention to it. We’re just going to write it off and say, “Government’s too slow.” By the time it gets around to us, the technology will have moved on, and their ideas will be obsolete. How do you respond to that? How do you build a better bridge to those folks? That is a pervasive sentiment among almost everybody I know in tech. I guess what I would say is, someone once said democracy is the worst system except for all the others, and I think that’s the way to look at this, is that it is intentionally clunky. It is supposed to be difficult, especially to enact a federal law. You don’t want federal law to change every two or four years in massive ways. You actually do want it to be difficult to enact a federal law. Look, their complaint is with the Constitution, right? Their complaint is with the basic configuration of our government and the premise of checks and balances, and of course, I get it. I wasn’t a CEO of a big publicly traded company or some sort of unicorn, but I ran a shop with a couple hundred people, and I understand what it means to be in charge of an operation, and I understand how satisfying it is to be able to assemble your smart people and make a call and then start to execute. This is why so many governors hate being in Congress, or otherwise successful CEOs or business people. Anyone who’s kind of a top executive has to modify their theory of change. I just respect the Constitution enough to say that the founders knew that you didn’t want a CEO of a country, that we didn’t want anyone with monarchical powers. Yes, is it maddening? When my person is in presidency, do I want there to be enhanced executive authority, and when my adversary is in power, do I want them to have less? Sure, but that’s just the nature of the beast. The other thing I’d say is that I’ve interacted with a bunch of CEOs obviously, and the tech community in particular has a tendency to think that they can solve for X. And they just look at us and go, “What a bunch of idiots. If I were there, I would simply do—” And it’s like, you don’t think Mark Warner is smart? You don’t think Chuck Schumer is smart? You don’t think that Hakeem Jeffries is smart? There are a lot of very bright people who are capable of being chief executives in that fashion, but we are in the American system of government, and I think in a lot of ways, what they’re complaining about is that not everything works like their world works. I don’t go into Silicon Valley and say, “Why aren’t there more checks on your power?” because I know that’s not how it operates, and they don’t have constitutional constraints. Forgive me if I sound mildly irritated at that complaint, because I feel like it’s quite shallow. It’s like this grandiose feeling that because they’ve mastered their area, that they can now just pivot to climate or democracy or civil rights and solve for X because the rest of us haven’t been thinking deeply enough about it or don’t have the courage to just act. Look, we’ve got courage. We’ve got a bunch of bright people. The Constitution makes it hard to enact legislation, and that’s on purpose. Do you think that is part of the reason for the rise in authoritarian thinking in this country? 100 percent. Maybe we should just have a king who makes some decisions. Elon [Musk], just fix it. Yes. I think people are not sure exactly what they want, but they are sure that they don’t want inaction. The frustration rising, I don’t think it’s necessarily economic agitation, but the correct observation that our government is stultified makes people look for alternatives, and people would like some action. The attractiveness of a strongman, I think, is not to be underestimated. Alright. Last question on this topic, and then I want to talk about our system of government and how we’re making policy right now — particularly tech policy — up against Europe, which is a much more Byzantine system of government. It seems to be more effective at actually passing regulations right now. But the Decoder question, this is a big one. We’ve described the system that you operate in, the pressures you’re under, the things you can and can’t do. How do you make decisions? What is your framework for making decisions? I start with my core values. I start with what I want to accomplish for people, and then I try to do an overlay on what I can accomplish for people. And then I try to divide my daily actions into sort of long lead time items that may take 10 or 20 or 30 years. So one of the things that I’m working on over time is to try to change the way especially the Democratic Party views housing, but that’s a political challenge, and we’re going to have to change public opinion. That is not something that I can just pass a bill and just claim success and move on to the next thing. But I also want to, for instance, enact telehealth legislation to extend these authorities that people have been using through the covid pandemic and continue the telehealth revolution. That’s an “I’ve got to get it done by the end of the year” thing. So I try to make sure that whatever I’m doing is rooted in my core values, but then I divide my objectives based on what can be accomplished right away and what’s going to take a little longer. The challenge, I think — just to be completely frank about it — is that sometimes I’m not even sure which thing is going to end up being ripe. So when we raised the tobacco age to 21, and I’m quite proud of that — and my father was a public health doctor and he would be very proud of that. When we sat down to do it because of the influence that big tobacco had in the Congress, I remember telling my staff that this was a 10- or 20-year project, and then we got it done in 16 months. Other things that I thought I could get done in one Congress, I’m in my 11th year and still working on. So part of what has to happen is you can have all the spreadsheets in the world and all the planning sessions and staff retreats in the world, but it is more about broken play running and being opportunistic about the art of the possible in the legislative arena than I think anybody in the private sector would be comfortable with because it is almost always one of those, “everybody’s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” Let’s talk about Europe for a second. You mentioned people want change. You mentioned that the United States in particular seems stultified. It is impossible for me where I sit covering the tech industry to not notice that Europe, the EU — which is a much more complex system of government, vastly more complex, almost impossible to describe to the average person how it works — is passing tech regulations left and right. Just this week, the Digital Markets Act led to Apple opening up the App Store on the iPhone allowing alternative web browsers. Apple is going into this kicking and screaming. They do not like this, but it’s happening to them in order to access the European market. The European Union has mandated USBC on iPhones. We can just go down the list of things that the European Union has done to regulate tech to make the products better or worse but to actually regulate the products. Why are they able to do it and we are not? I’ll give you a couple of reasons, and on this one, I don’t want you to think I’m defending Congress’ inaction on tech policy. I do think it’s indefensible. It’s a couple of things. It’s the basic sort of dysfunction and polarization, that’s number one. Number two is, for whatever set of reasons on tech policy, there’s a lot of a desire among members on both sides of the aisle to be the mayor of the issue rather than to try to get to some sort of solution. So I think one of the things that Leader Schumer has done that’s been extraordinarily successful is with bipartisan senators establishing these roundtables on AI where we’re doing deep dives and not allowing it to become a partisan issue. But I do think the incentives right now are, “I’m the one that’s fighting the tech industry. No, I’m the one that’s fighting the tech industry.” And people’s kind of political itch gets scratched without ever having enacted anything. And then there’s a little bit of the perfect being the enemy of the good that people want to solve everything before they solve individual problems. USBC is a really good example. We don’t do the small things that could be large. I have an AI bill, which doesn’t solve all of the problems that could be presented by AI, but it seems to be on a bipartisan basis pretty straightforward, which is, if something is generated using a generative AI, people should be able to know that with a watermark. And I can’t find anybody who disagrees with that. But the challenge is, how do you pass just that without everybody saying, “Well, as long as there’s a moving vehicle, how about my more comprehensive Rube Goldberg machine to make sure we protect against everything?” — fraud or catastrophic risk or national security risk. And then by the time you’re done having this conversation, my thing sounds small and it’s not a big enough deal and we can’t pass it. I do think we need to understand that this is a generational challenge, and we need to start doing some of the small things that are straightforward rather than waiting until we have a perfect solution. Sorry, one final thing, which is maybe not the biggest deal, but it’s probably worth mentioning, is that there was a concerted effort on the part of the tech platforms who did not want any regulation to, as Senator Chris Murphy calls it, tech-shame members. They did it really effectively. When Mark Zuckerberg came to testify, a couple of members were betraying that they were not digital natives, and then it became a good way to ridicule the members. I still remember, I was super jet-lagged, and I asked Zuckerberg a pretty legitimate question, which is, “Within WhatsApp, as you are transmitting messages, is any of that data, even disaggregated, even anonymized, feeding into their ad algorithm?” But I said, because I was tired, I said, “When you email on WhatsApp,” and then Zuckerberg was able to spend all of his time correcting me that it’s an encrypted messaging thing and not emailing. I mean, I’m 51, so I’m not trying to pretend I know everything, but I knew that. I just misspoke. And the reason that that sticks in my craw is that I never got the answer in the hearing. I think it’s a very legitimate question. It’s a question people still have. And then it became, they just did these mashups of, “Look at all these idiot senators, and because they’re not experts or engineers or coders, they have no right to regulate.” Well, listen, I don’t know how an F35 operates, but I’m on the Defense Appropriations Committee. I’m the chairman of the Transportation and HUD Committee, and I’ve never been an affordable housing developer or run a nonprofit that provides resources for individuals with HIV / AIDS, and yet, I’m in charge of both oversight and funding for those things. So this idea that you have to have deep, deep expertise in order to be able to weigh in on public policy has become this kind of shield and sword that the tech companies have used very effectively against members. And members don’t like to get embarrassed in viral moments. And so everyone’s very cautious, and it’s not the main thing, but it’s emblematic of why we can’t even get serious about it. There’s going to be a hearing this week about kids’ safety in Congress. The CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino, will be there. The CEO of TikTok will be there. Some other folks will be there. I hear you say that members are cautious. I know that hearing is going to be a whole bunch of grandstanding chaos. Square that for me because that doesn’t make any sense to me. I think they are cautious about legislating in a serious way, and they are incautious about trying to create a viral moment where they look tough with the CEO of X or Meta or wherever. So you’re right that it kind of feels a little bit in tension. But back to what we were talking about earlier, the incentives are aligned for a member to just have a viral moment, throw a bill in the hopper, and be done with it. And the point here is that we are lawmakers, not law adjusters. Jon Stewart should go viral. Trevor Noah should go viral. Kids on TikTok should go viral. Members should enact laws. Is there a sense right now in Congress that Europe is regulating our tech industry for us? Because when I talk to tech executives, they are besides themselves saying, “How is it that we have an American tech industry that is now beholden to what a bunch of Europeans want, and our government is not either protecting us, which you could disagree or not disagree with, but also not having any of these ideas on their own.” Because I think those companies would prefer that their regulatory constraints come from us and are exported around the world instead of exporting their products to face regulatory constraints from another system of government. I think they might think that at the CEO level, but at the government relations level and the sort of chief legal officer level, they still are set up to, basically, they hire lobby shops with the Democratic and Republican side, and the government relations people report to the, say, senior vice president for government relations, which reports to the board, and they go, “Good news, we killed it again.” And so they might say that they want to be regulated and they want this to be comprehensive and they don’t want it to be either state by state or to have to operate in a patchwork of international laws. And yet, they are the very ones in the Congress through their lobbyists trying to kill everything. And look, I had a bill that established a duty of care, right? Basic idea is, I do not believe the notice and consent regime — the, “Hey, here’s how we’re going to use your data,” and then you click “I agree” — really does much for consumers at all. And I think requiring more in the notice and consent space is stipulating to something that’s not true, which is that people may read the disclaimer. They just click “I agree” and move on. So my view is the companies are going to collect the data. They should have the same obligation that an accountant or a lawyer or a tax preparer has, which is, “Yeah, we’re going to use your data, but we promise not to use it against you.” A lot of the big companies were perfectly comfortable with that, but the chief legal officers and the government relations folks were super terrified about what that would mean because you’re empowering an expert agency, in this case, it would’ve been the Federal Trade Commission, to interpret what it means to have a duty of care, and they don’t like the lack of clarity so they killed it. And I shouldn’t say they killed it. We’re still in charge, but they influenced members to be nervous enough that it was not able to be enacted. So I pushed back a little bit,  and tell me which CEO you’re talking about, but I do think they think they want federal regulation to make sure that the United States is the leader in tech policy, but the way they manifest their government relations shop in the Congress is risk-averse, Whack-a-Mole, try to kill everything. Do you feel the pressure that the European Union is now the leader in tech policy and the United States is not? Yes. But on the other hand, some of the things that they’re doing make a lot of sense to me. In the same way that, for instance, the California privacy law is maybe a suboptimal way to try to regulate some of the actions of these tech companies and that we should have a federal law and a federal standard, both because of interstate commerce issues but also just making the thing work mechanically speaking — it’s still better than nothing. If we’re stuck in the mud, then Europe should act. And if we’re stuck in the mud, then California should act. And that may be the only thing that precipitates federal action because these tech companies will have to actually call the question: “You really don’t like this patchwork? Well, there is a way to solve this.” And one of the things that I’ve said is whether it’s privacy policy or children’s safety or social media regulation, Section 230, I’m open to a federal law that preempts state action, but only if it’s sufficiently strong. And what they’ve been wanting is a federal law that preempts state action, which basically enshrines the status quo in place. Let’s talk about some of these specific issues. Let’s start with AI because it is the thing. It is the elephant in the room. Europe hasn’t figured it out. We haven’t figured it out. It is where we might be able to take more of a leadership position. The White House obviously released its executive order. There have been these roundtables in Congress. Let me start with the hardest problem here. Literally this week, as we’re speaking, there’s deepfake porn of Taylor Swift on the X platform. It spread to it from Telegram. X has whatever trust and safety disaster that it has. They didn’t really stop it. It went viral. It was trending at one point. The Swifties are trying to stop it. It’s chaos. Everyone I know involved in trust and safety looked at generative AI years ago and said, “This is going to happen. This is going to happen to women on the internet. People are going to make deepfake porn of women on the internet,” and we haven’t done anything about it. And now we’re at this moment, and maybe this moment will catalyze some change. Can that be stopped? Do you have a view on that? How would you stop that? How would you pass a law to stop that? So I don’t know, mechanically and sort of at the technical level, how plausible it is to stop all of this, but some of these things aren’t even illegal. You’ve got a bunch of generative AI products that could very easily be required as a matter of federal law to have embedded in the code either to watermark if it’s a visual image or some other audio or other disclosure to clarify that something is not real. Now, you get into a more thorny public policy question, which is, “Well, doesn’t that person still have a right not to have a fake porn image posted of them even if in the bottom-right corner it says “Made by generative AI.” So I think these are tough questions, but it goes back to what I was saying: can we please start with the not-most-complicated, not edge-case questions? And the stuff that people can plainly see is preposterous and offensive and dangerous to people and others. To me, a very scary example is the ability to commit financial fraud and have, you or I, to have our voice call our mother or father and say, “Look, I need to transfer 500 bucks to your bank account so you can pay your groceries. Give me your routing number.” And that, I think, is so scalable and so terrifying, we need to act immediately on that. And it is a little shocking the extent to which some of these things are not already illegal. The last example, of course, would be illegal in the first instance because it is fraud. But equipping law enforcement with those tools… I guess what I think is we should start with the easy stuff first, the obvious stuff first, and the most urgent stuff first. Because I think part of what’s fascinating about AI is that it allows everybody to stroke their chin and imagine a future that’s different, and what’s the future of creativity, and what does it mean to be a human, and how much work provides enough meaning for people to not lose a sense of self? And those are all angels on the head of a pin. There are a bunch of things that we need to address now and not overcomplicate the questions. Well, those are two things, right? One, you can deepfake my voice and call my parents. That seems bad, just straightforwardly bad. Two is, women all over the internet are having essentially nonconsensual revenge porn made of them. You should be able to stop that. I don’t know what mechanisms to stop that. Historically, the mechanism has been like copyright law. I’m an old copyright lawyer. I wasn’t any good at it, which is probably why I can’t think of a way to make copyright law solve this problem. But it seems to be hitting a wall. How would you solve it? I don’t know. I’m not even a lawyer, but it is something that I think we need to get at immediately. And there are a couple of things. Again, in the AI space, Schumer has been really good about this and sort of dividing stuff that we ought to do immediately that is urgent, including on the campaign side. There are a bunch of things that we can’t wait on including giving the government authority over catastrophic national security risk. I mean, that’s something that cannot wait. And we can wrestle with the tougher stuff over a longer period of time. But I think that’s the right way to look at this: impatient about the urgent tragedies that are upon us but not overreacting and trying to create some Rube Goldberg machine that stops this tech from flourishing. Because I think the challenge with that is that we are not the only place where this technology is emerging. And if we don’t make public policy, then I do think some of these companies are just going to go elsewhere. You mentioned it’s an election year. You mentioned national security. This is going to be a very contentious election between [Donald] Trump and [Joe] Biden. I feel comfortable saying it will be Trump and Biden. They both have pretty recognizable voices. Both sides are pretty motivated to make the other guy look very bad, look very dumb. Is there any pressure to make this stuff happen before this campaign season kicks into what will be the most contentious, silliest campaign season that I think I’ve ever faced? Yeah. And I’m of two minds here. First of all, the answer is yes, and on a bipartisan basis, we’re doing reasonably well on keeping this one to be… And I think part of it is, there’s a little self-motivation among members who have to run that they don’t want to have to contend with a bunch of lies about them and their voice being faked or all the rest of it. I think there’s an opportunity to do something on this pretty darn quick. The other thing I would say, though, is that lying in politics is not a new phenomenon, and faking things in politics is not a new phenomenon. The ability to scale it via robocalls or social media posts or whatever is obviously a kind of category change. But I think we should always be wary of the high likelihood that candidates and then noncandidate committees lie about their opponents. And so I’m of two minds. I’m not sure whether this misinformation election cycle is going to be orders of magnitude worse, or is this just going to feel like the same thing and there’s a new tool in the toolkit for the dark arts? Yeah, I would say that one of the things that struck me about 2016 and 2020 was there were all these tools to make new kinds of believable lies, but then actually just lying, just dead-ahead confidently lying seemed to be pretty effective for everyone. But this does seem different. You can make a video of Donald Trump saying something he didn’t say. You can make a video of Joe Biden saying something he didn’t say. It looks real enough on a social media feed. People see it, they move on, they’re not going to dive into it. That is a new kind of danger. I don’t think that’s just a robocall scales, fake voices. That is messing with people’s belief about what actually happened or didn’t happen from the source. Yeah. And it’s getting into their brain stem. I agree with that. I think that this is... But I just don’t know in the end whether this moves votes at the margins because it’s just, there will be a point at which the zone is so flooded that people are smart and can sort of recognize that this is a lot of garbage, and I’m going to just tune out. I came from the state legislature in Hawaii, and the main way to communicate with voters in a State House race is direct mail, still hard copy, card stock, glossy, in the mailbox — still, in 2024. There’s a lot of lying in the mailbox, too. And it is also irrefutable in the sense that there’s nothing you can do once the thing is in the mailbox with the lie. And the Constitution provides campaigns wide latitude to engage in bullshittery. So I honestly am not entirely sure whether I think this cycle is likely to be orders of magnitude more nuts or whether we’re going to look at it like, “Yeah, that was the year where some of these operatives tried a new way of being shitty, but it didn’t really move the needle.” Let me ask a very reductive version of this question. It kind of ties this all together. Should it be illegal at the federal level to take someone’s image and make it do something that person didn’t do? Yes, I do believe that. Now, I’m not a constitutional lawyer, so I do think there are some challenges there, but I think people have a right to their own thoughts, and people have a right to their own image. And we’re going to have to clarify that in the context of both the First Amendment and Section 230 and all the rest of it. But there seems to be, to me, some space between the parameters of the First Amendment and Section 230, which gives platforms indemnification for things that are posted and outright lies. Not just, “Hey, Brian Schatz is shitty at his job,” which I do believe would be a lie. But also, “Hey, Brian Schatz said this thing.” And it turns out I didn’t say this thing. Well, that’s also a lie. I’m not sure that’s definitely supposed to be illegal. And then the new threshold would be like, “Here is video of Brian Schatz saying something.” And it’s just not the case that I said it because you just used AI to make it seem like I said it. That seems to me to be something we can make public policy about without bumping up either against the parameters of existing statutory law or the Constitution itself. Is there any action on that front? Have you seen language to that effect? Are people working on it? Yes, people are working on all of this. And listen, I’m very appreciative of and loyal to Chuck Schumer, so I don’t want to make it sound too much like I’m schlepping for him. But I am super impressed at this process because everything I described to you about the kind of dysfunction of Congress in the tech space in particular — it’s sort of the overlay of it’s dysfunctional in the first place, it’s also hard to pass a law in the first place, but then we have these particular dynamics that make it hard to pass tech legislation — he’s been able to avoid by setting up these longform deep dive forums. And you got members… Members don’t sit for scarcely 17 minutes, let alone two, three hours. And we are plopping ourselves down with experts from the nonprofit sector, certainly the private sector, from labor, from academia, and we’re trying to sink our teeth into this and chunking it down by category: catastrophic risk, national security risk, fraud, the future of work, IP, elections. We’re chunking it down, and then the project on a bipartisan basis, again, is to kind of divide this temporally. What’s ready to move, and what must move in this calendar year? And then what’s going to take a little more work? And arguably, not just because it will take time but because it ought to take time. Because we probably should see a few more cards before we lay down a statutory framework as if we’re already sure of what the law should say. In some instances, to me, I want to see a few more cards before we lay down a statute. Let me take that framework and apply it to the other bill that you’re working on in the tech policy space: KOSA, the Kids Online Safety Act. It feels like you’ve seen all the cards you need to see there, right? You’ve got a bill, it says kids under 13 should just not be allowed to use social media. Up to 17, they need parental consent. I’m just going to read the little summary of the bill here. “Upon covered providers, there’s a duty of care to keep minors away from content that would be considered to cause anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behaviors, and other harms like sexual exploitation.” And there’s data that says social media is, particularly with teen girls, causing a massive crisis of depression. Have you seen all the cards you need to see there? You’re like, we just got to make some regulation now? 100 percent. And I’m a co-sponsor of the Kids Online Safety Act, but that’s led by others. That’s Dick Blumenthal and others. I’m the primary co-sponsor of the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act. Now, I don’t want to get into too many of the differences, but I’ll just say, my bill does just three things. Under 13, you can’t be online. [Ages] 13 through 17, you need parental consent. And importantly in my view, 13 through 17, no algorithmic boosting within that session. Because I think it is fair to say that these algorithms are sort of overpowering the brain stem of teenagers. And I am absolutely prepared to say that whatever the potential First Amendment equities may be, that both legally and morally, I’m ready to say that the downside of social media for kids 12 and under way outweighs the upside. Sure, they can find a recipe. Sure, they can find friendship. Sure, they can post interesting things and find joy in all of that. But one of the things that’s being asked of us is to kind of get longitudinal data to establish the direct connection between kids using social media and all of this increased anxiety and depression and polarization and suicidal ideation and all the rest of it. And by the way, decreased exercise and sedentary activity, all that. What they mean by longitudinal data is we have to wait one or two more generations while these kids’ brains are being melted. So I have seen enough. I am confident that the net impact of getting kids off of social media 12 and under would be a positive. And interestingly, I can’t find a single person, regular human, who disagrees with this. Even kids are like, “Yeah, please just take this damn thing away from me.” The algorithmic boosting thing is a little more challenging because some people like their algorithms, and I understand that. But a lot of people are not in the position… the kind of Meta position is like, “We want to give a bunch of tools to users to modify the algorithm.” Well, that’s fine, but 14-year-olds don’t modify their algorithm, 14-year-olds don’t even understand what is happening to them. You know this as well as I do, but I think it is absolutely worth saying that social media companies depend on eyeballs for revenue and for their quarterly earnings calls. And I don’t think they started out this way, but they figured out that, unfortunately, the way to get eyeballs, the way to get people to linger on things, the way to get people to click on things, is to upset them. And so now you have… The syllogism goes that these companies have arguably a fiduciary obligation to systematically upset tens of millions of children. And I don’t think that’s okay. And I don’t think they have the First Amendment, an algorithm doesn’t have a First Amendment right. And I also think a 12-year-old has some First Amendment rights, but they’re not the same as an adult’s. And also your right to go on the internet and use Meta is not enshrined in the United States Constitution. So let me ask you a few follow-up questions here. That’s a lot of ideas. And I’ve been talking to people about how we might regulate content on the internet for a long, long time. For most of that time, what people talked about was Section 230. You yourself have brought up Section 230. And I have always felt that the conversation about Section 230 is kind of a smoke screen. Because you can’t just go regulate content on the internet. The First Amendment exists, it’s the first one. People are pretty familiar with it. It literally prevents Congress from making laws about speech. You can threaten companies by saying, “We’ll take your 230 protection away and unleash a tidal wave of litigation that will basically crush you. So do what we want with the speech regulation, and we’ll just keep hammering away about Section 230.” And that threat has worked or not worked. I think it is notable that Trump and Biden have the exact same position on Section 230 because they need the exact same leverage to get whatever they want. On the flip side, it seems like “Okay, we need to protect kids” just jumps right over the First Amendment. You can go to the Supreme Court and say, “This is a narrowly tailored regulation in that Congress has in the best interest of our nation to protect kids. We’re going to do some content regulation here. We’re going to say you can show this to kids and not show this to kids.” Is that how you’re thinking about it? This is the one that we can get through and directly regulate the content. 100 percent. I think the art of the possible is, let’s at least agree that kids should be protected. But I also want to just agree with you about Section 230. I have a bipartisan bill that does some tinkering with Section 230, but you’re right, when people talk [about] Section 230… I mean, I tweeted one time, anybody who talks about eliminating Section 230 has to describe what Section 230 does. No one knows what Section 230 does. I mean, it’s actually not a particularly complicated statute, but it became just an incantation for politicians to say, “I’m anti-big tech.” No one’s sure what it means. And if you took away those protections, the internet would be more, not less, of a cesspool. And that’s the really important thing, is that they would be unable to do any content moderation, and then everything would be more of a sewer. Do I think just like the Communications Decency Act, just like the Telecommunications Act, that we should be iterating this over time, and Section 230 is not some sacrosanct bill or law on a tablet that must not be touched? Yeah, I think we ought to make changes, and there are some pretty rational changes that ought to be made, but you’re right that it has become a distraction. It has become a sort of bludgeon. And the reason that Section 230 has not been repealed is that in the end, the product would be way worse. Whatever challenges we have on the internet, we still do want Meta and Twitter and others to be able to do whatever content moderation they’re doing. We could argue that they’re not doing enough, but we certainly don’t want them to hear from their lawyers, “Hey, listen, if you touch this, we could be in for trouble damages four times gross profits in the United States.” And they’ll just say, “Fine, we’re going to keep providing this platform, but we’re not going to moderate at all.” And no moderation is quite bad. I think what people are mad at is they don’t like the moderation decisions — not that moderation happens at all. But the laws about children’s safety, that’s not some end run around the First Amendment. That’s just driving right at it and saying, “Okay, this is the thing that will stand up to First Amendment scrutiny. We’re going to say to the platforms, ‘You can and cannot show this speech to these people in this way — algorithmically boosted, in this way.’ And we’re going to face some legal challenges. We’re going to face some First Amendment scrutiny in our narrowly tailored policy that has a compelling government interest, strict scrutiny under the law.” It will survive that strict scrutiny. Because it is kids, and kids are a political winner. Yeah, and I mean you just described the legal argument, right? Compelling government interest and all the rest of it, but it’s also the public policy argument, which is like, “Can we please argue about everything else but agree that an 11-year-old shouldn’t have their brain stem melted?” So we started by talking about bad faith, and you are notable for calling out the bad faith of your opponents. This is a law that there’s a lot of interpretation inside of this law, and we live in a time when LGBTQ rights are under attack, trans rights are under attack, books are being banned, abortion is not legal in every state. And the opponents of these bills say, “Okay, this is going to keep kids from accessing information about their own reproductive healthcare. This will keep kids from finding communities of like-minded queer people in states where that is becoming more and more illegal. And that is a cost that is higher than the benefit.” Do you see that calculation playing out? Yeah, I do. This one was hard for me. I’ve sort of met with and talked to a lot of LGBTQ rights organizations, and I think we’re going to be able to find a sweet spot here. The challenge is that we are operating under the assumption that every kid is online, and the only way they’re online is through social media. So if you run the Trevor Project or some other LGBTQ rights organization, your main means of reaching a child is through a social media platform. It doesn’t have to be that way. They can meet each other in real life, they can still use a web browser, they can still find community. But it is true that if all kids, if all 12-year-olds, are no longer on social media, then that won’t be the way they find information. We’ve just decided that that’s true. Those equities I think are legitimate. I do think that the social media platforms encourage a level of sensitivity and paranoia among those organizations that once I talk with them, I’m able to go, “Look, that’s not what we’re doing here.” But I mean, for me, there is a little bit of a balancing act because, although my bill is bipartisan, and it’s not the same as what’s happened in Arkansas or Utah or anywhere else, it sort of rhymes with it enough where people are quite worried that this is actually just a mechanism for both governmental and parental control of queer kids and access to public health services and community and just feeling like they have some sense of belonging. So I’m very sensitive to the potential problem here, which is that when Senator Blackburn on the Kids Online Safety Act, I don’t want to get the quote wrong, but it was something about, “We’re going to use this bill to kind of go after LGBTQ groups who are targeting kids.” I went, “Whoa, sign me out of that.” I want, again, for us to do something that is narrow enough where we can all agree, and frankly, you and I may be in a little bit of disagreement about this. I want it to be content-neutral. That’s why I want that bright-line 12 and under: no. 13 and over: with your parents’ consent and no algorithmic boosting. But this idea that there would be a government panel that determines harm or likelihood of causing anxiety seems to be a little dangerous if you’re looking at the kind of federalist project out in America. I don’t like the idea of a state government panel saying, “Hey, this queer content is going to turn kids — whatever they’re thinking and saying.” I just want to make clear, I want no part of that, which is why my bill’s content-neutral and just has this bright line of 12 versus 13. Is it arbitrary? Could it have been 14? Sure. But you have to draw lines, and we do that for driving and voting and drinking. So I just think this is another place we need to draw a hard line. I want to come back to bad faith. The Marsha Blackburn quote is, “We should be protecting minor children from the transgender in this culture.” And then she said that this bill would provide a duty of care. You know that there’s a lot of bad faith. If there’s a hypothetical second Trump administration and there’s a Trump FTC armed with these powers in this bill to go after companies that might be disseminating information about people’s rights because they might hypothetically reach a child so then we can censor all of it anyway, isn’t that a problem? Isn’t that the bad-faith problem neatly expressed here? This is the thing we can do because it protects children, and the repercussions be damned. Yeah, I think you’ve described a little bit the difference between my bill and the Kids Online Safety Act. I am very uncomfortable with... Look, I like a duty of care as it relates to customer data because that’s already an established principle in other sectors. Like I said, banking information, financial information, HIPAA, your lawyer, they all have information that is deeply sensitive, and the basic expectation is they will lose their job if they use that data against you. Not that they can’t share it or use it in order to do their job, but that they can’t use it for purposes other than what you could reasonably expect them to use it for. So I like a duty of care in that context. But if the duty of care is like, “Hey, the government itself gets to adjudicate what content may or may not be harmful to a child,” I think that just gives too much power to individual politicians to referee what content is dangerous. And let me take a conservative example. Do I think that the government ought to be able to go in and say, “The National Rifle Association is encouraging people to join and do youth gun camps,” and there might be some progressive groups that say, “Look, this is endangering children”? I just don’t think we want to go down that slippery slope, and we don’t have to. We can avoid that whole argument by just saying we know exactly what’s going on. Anyone who’s a parent knows what’s going on. The surgeon general knows what’s going on. You can believe both the data that’s incoming and our own experience and our own eyes. It’s the algorithmic boosting, and it’s kids getting online, and especially on social media platforms, too early in their lives to be able to sort it all out. We can address those two problems without even touching the question of the content itself. I’ve got a five-year-old. She wants to be a YouTuber when she grows up. This is terrifying. She asked me for a YouTube account the other day so strangers could watch her videos. She’s never made a video in her life, but she’s already there in her brain. Then she asked me to be on Roblox, and I told her she has to learn how to read before she can use Roblox. And this is going to buy me some time, but it’s not going to buy me forever. That’s great, I’m going to provide parental consent to be on these platforms. The bill is like: your parents need to say yes. But just in my experience, all the parents end up saying yes. Does this stop anything? So that’s a really interesting question. Probably slows down and precipitates a conversation for a 13-, 14-, 15-year-old. But I do think it gives a lot of parents some measure of comfort to be able to establish a societal norm. Do kids drink when they’re 17? Sure they do. Do they drink less than they would if it were legal at 16? That’s also true. So this idea that, well, kids are going to get a VPN, yeah some kids will get a VPN. Just like... Well, I won’t say, standing outside of a 7/11 on Kilauea Avenue trying to see if some 25-year-old will buy me a six-pack when I’m 17 years old or whatever. This is a hypothetical, you understand— Senator. … But that’s– Senator. But I think the point is that most parents I talk to would be so pleased to be able to say to their 11-year-old who is demanding an Instagram account, “I’m sorry, it’s not permissible.” Right? Now, will some kids be enterprising and figure out a way, and will some kids have their parents set up a fake Instagram account through the adult age verification process? Sure. But I still think it’s worth it to establish some bright lines societally. But that doesn’t obviate the difficulty for every parent, whether you’re a parent of young kids or teenagers or preteens or whatever. It’s still going to be a rough world here. But I think what the government has to do is establish, at our most basic level, that we are the ally of parents in helping to navigate all of this. We started off by talking about the incentives of Congress and how the incentives are toward virality and not necessarily policymaking. Shouldn’t there be some rules from members of Congress and how they use social media? This is what I come back to. I feel like the adults are being driven more insane than the kids. Their brains are being melted. Congress’ brains are being melted on the daily. And the kids are sort of fine. I talk to a lot of teenagers who know social media is bad for them, and they are learning how to have boundaries to this thing that is just sort of always happening to them. And then I talk to politicians sometimes, not you sir, but I talk to politicians sometimes who seem utterly captivated by how many likes their tweets got. It feels like maybe the action’s pointed in the wrong direction, but you can’t say protecting adults from themselves passes First Amendment scrutiny so we’re pointing all the action at kids. Yeah, I think it’s a fair criticism. I’m not really sure that there’s anything you could do by rule or law to stop adults, especially elected representatives of their districts or their states, from speaking out in whatever manner that they see fit, even including being stupid on social media. So you can’t make a law against that. But I think your point is exactly right, which is that we are pointing at something that we feel we can solve and where we can sort of separate ourselves from the problem and not admit that to greater or lesser extents that part of what’s happening in our politics — not the whole thing, we can’t blame it all on the internet or social media — but at least part of what’s happening in our politics is a tendency toward understanding political success not as the enactment of laws or policies that actually help people but the extent to which people say “Good job” online. And those are entirely different things. And I don’t know why I’ve been able to maintain some perspective, but I just remember... I forgot what I did, but I was really proud of it on substance. I had delivered something for Hawaii, and in the same day, I tweeted something sassy about Donald Trump, and Wolf Blitzer’s producers called my comms director, and they wanted to get me on the TV to talk about my tweet, not to talk about my accomplishments. So one of the things I try to do is verbalize that although that’s tantalizing, that is not the job. One platform that we have talked about but we haven’t talked about in substance very directly is TikTok. There was a lot of action to ban TikTok or sell it to Oracle or sell it to Microsoft. Do you think TikTok should be banned or sold to an American company? I would like it to be sold to an American company. I have not quite gotten to the point where I think it should be banned. But part of my analysis here is sort of a question of fact. I do want to understand better who controls the algorithm and the extent to which the government of China is using it as a geopolitical, strategic vector. I just don’t know that that’s happening. I think it is worth monitoring. I think it is worth being on the borderline of paranoid about. But I don’t want to assume something is happening without having that evidence. But it is very worrisome, especially if you can imagine a situation where if the situation with Taiwan gets a little more dicey, do they have the ability to start doing things that they’ve been promising through their American subsidiary that they wouldn’t do all along? So I worry about the national security risks. But other than that, they’re just another social media platform that should be subject to the same scrutiny and the same public policy as everybody else. Alright, last big-picture question. It’s an election year. It feels like people are going to tune out of it because it’s the same two guys, the same kind of noise. There is a stultified Congress, as you have described, the inaction is high, the theatrics are high. How should people think about tuning in and constructively participating in this election cycle, versus sort of tuning out and letting the chaos rein? Part of what’s happening pre-Trump officially getting the nomination was the kind of parlor game based in Washington is like, well, is Biden going to just be a one-termer? And maybe Nikki Haley can pull it off, and all the rest of it. But now we’re facing a rather stark choice. And one of the things that I think is a little maddening for those of us who are part of this historic Congress where we passed the biggest climate bill in human history, where we reduced the price of medicine, where we passed infrastructure, where we did all these extraordinary things, probably the most productive Congress since LBJ, and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden deserve a lot of credit for it. And yet, part of the problem is like, yeah, but Joe Biden is old. And I’m not sure that that argument is going to be as compelling as it was in an odd-numbered year. Once we’re facing this choice and you have this president with a record of accomplishment, with costs going down, knock on wood, with a relatively healthy economy, lots of problems remaining in the world, but a pretty good record to point to, that people are going to be thinking about the records of these two men. And if we could play the parlor game and pick another person, would your average 22-year-old voter pick someone else? Sure. But politics is about choices, right? And Biden himself always says, “Don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.” And I think that’s what this election is going to be about. Alright.

https://time.com/6553429/gabriel-attal-france-prime-minister/,"Emmanuel Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France’s youngest ever Prime Minister on Tuesday, after previous Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced her resignation on Monday. Attal is also the first openly gay person to hold the job, making his selection a historic first in multiple categories. He has a civil partnership with Stéphane Sejourné, a French Member of the European Parliament. Attal previously served as France’s education minister, where he instituted new performance metrics to measure children’s academic performances and implemented a controversial ban on Abayas in schools. His appointment comes months before the European Parliament elections in June. According to an IPSOS poll that was released in December, Attal is the French politician with the highest approval rating. He has rapidly climbed the ranks of French politics over the past 10 years, starting out as an obscure advisor in the health ministry. “When I appointed [Gabriel Attal] as education minister, I knew he had the necessary energy and courage for the task,” Macron said during a TV interview in December. “I’m proud to have nurtured new talents.” But experts say Attal will grapple with the same challenges as his predecessor. That includes a resurgent right that looks set to make gains in the June European Parliament elections and the lack of a majority in the French parliament that makes enacting Macron's agenda difficult. Macron has also seen his own popularity decrease in the last year and a half, after mass protests erupted over his pension reform plans and members of his own centrist Renaissance party vehemently opposed an immigration bill he hoped to pass.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68078182,"Thailand's reformist political champion will be re-instated as an MP after winning a trial his supporters say was aimed at ending his political career. The Harvard-educated Pita Limjaroenrat and his Move Forward party won the most votes in a huge election win last year. But he failed to take charge after being blocked by the unelected Senate. The charismatic young leader was seen as a threat to the establishment for promising to reform harsh royal insult laws and to tackle military influence. While negotiating to form a coalition government after his election victory, two court cases were lodged against him. His supporters saw this as part of a wider campaign by conservative political forces to oust him from politics and discredit his party's ideas. On Wednesday he was acquitted in the first case against him, but he faces a potentially more serious legal challenge next week. The Constitutional Court will rule again, this time on whether his plan to reform Thailand's harsh lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to ""overthrow the democratic regime of government with the king as the head of state"". A verdict finding that Move Forward acted unconstitutionally in this way could lead to it being dissolved, and its leadership being banned from politics. In 2019 the court dissolved Move Forward's previous incarnation Future Forward, after it too had done better than expected in an election. That verdict sparked off months of street protests and unprecedented public criticism of the monarchy. On Wednesday Pita's supporters cheered outside the Constitutional Court  when they heard he had won his case, chanting ""PM Pita"". ""It was Pita himself who told us that we have to live with hope,""  Luksikarn Tangchotithanavid, 40, told the BBC. ""Our generation can read and understand the law. We know what is written and how it should be executed. According to the law, he should not be disqualified in this case."" Mr Pita was acquitted of violating election law by owning shares in a media company while contesting last year's election. He had been suspended as an MP last July over the allegations and banned from sitting in parliament, forcing him to give up leadership of his party. His defence has been that he inherited the shares from his father, but that the company had not been operating for many years, long before he ran  for office. A majority of judges agreed with him in their ruling on Wednesday. ""Holding the shares did not violate the law. The court has ruled his MP status has not ended,"" Judge Punya Udchachon said. Before the verdict, Mr Pita also told reporters he would keep fighting for the reforms his party had promised. As well as amending the lese majeste law these include breaking up business monopolies and limiting  the military's influence in politics and business. This platform proved very popular in the 2023 election, giving Move Forward 151 of the 500 seats in parliament, more than any other party. ""No matter the result I will still be working for the people,"" he said on Wednesday before the verdict. ""[This court case] is only a detour. Regardless of the verdict we will continue fighting."" Thailand under King Maha Vajiralongkorn has seen a significant increase in the use of lese majeste laws to silence political critics. More than 260 people have been charged under the law since November 2020. Last week, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to 50 years in jail for comments that were ruled to have defamed the Thai monarchy. This was the most severe sentence ever handed down under the country's notorious lese majeste laws.

The verdict could lead to the dissolution of Move Forward party. Limjaroenrat remains committed to fighting for his party's promised reforms despite the legal challenges. Thailand has seen an increase in the use of lese majeste laws to silence political dissent under King Maha Vajiralongkorn."

Listen to this article 00:00 20:06 Produced by ElevenLabs and NOA, News Over Audio, using AI narration. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here. Americans don’t trust one another, and they don’t trust the government. This mistrust is so pervasive that it can feel natural, but it isn’t. Profound distrust has risen within my lifetime; it is intensifying, and it threatens to make democracy impossible. Many readers will say, “Of course I don’t trust the candidate who tried to steal the last election, or the party that supports him!” And they would be right to do so. Election denialism, political violence, and a willingness to resort to anticonstitutional measures to take or hold power are all acute threats to democracy, and they are concentrated in Donald Trump’s Republican Party. But there are also chronic threats to democracy. They are not limited to one party, let alone one leader. They affect us all, and they make the acute threats more dangerous and harder to overcome. To have any hope of rebuilding democratic trust, we will need two things that have been neglected for decades in American life. One is civic virtue—serious and respectful engagement in the hard work of living with disagreement and difference. The other is a radical commitment to building a social world where trust comes more readily. The past half century has brought a collapse in Americans’ trust in one another and their government. In 1972, more than 45 percent of Americans said that most people are trustworthy. Since 2006, the number has been barely more than 30 percent. Young respondents are particularly mistrustful: In 2019, 73 percent of those under 30 agreed that “most of the time, people just look out for themselves,” and almost as many said, “Most people would take advantage of you if they got the chance.” Eliot Cohen: When leaders fail Trust in government has taken an even greater hit. In 1964, 77 percent of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time. In 2022, that number was 22 percent, and it has been languishing in that neighborhood since 2010. In 1973, amid riots, domestic terrorism, the Watergate scandal, and clashes over the Vietnam War, majorities trusted Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court. Majorities (in many cases substantial ones) mistrust all of those institutions now. Trust in newspapers and public schools has traveled the same trajectory. Put these trends together, and Americans are saying that being governed by other Americans is intolerable. Why would you submit to institutions you don’t trust, run by people you don’t trust? Why would you trust any institution run by people who would take advantage of you if they had the chance? As the 2020 presidential election approached, about 90 percent of each candidate’s supporters said that if the other guy won, he would do lasting damage to the country. Turnout in 2020 was the highest since 1900, but the motive was fear more than hope—total mobilization to keep the other side out of power. All-pervading mistrust fosters overheated politics, in which everything is at stake but little is accomplished, because so much of the effort is defensive. It also encourages constitutional crisis: If the other side is morally unacceptable and dangerous, supporting extreme efforts to keep it out of power becomes more plausible. The collapse of trust encourages, even if it does not ensure, a collapse of democracy. Democracy places a unique demand on trust. The usual measures of trust, which ask whether we trust other people and institutions to do the right thing, assume a morally static world: We know the right thing to do, and the question is whether a neighbor, stranger, or public official will do it. But democracy matters most, and is most difficult, when citizens decide to change course morally. The New Deal, the Voting Rights and Civil Rights Acts, the revolution in environmental laws in the 1970s—they all succeeded as far as they did because they were democratic choices to live by different values. That kind of progress means putting our futures in one another’s hands. Destabilizing levels of mistrust feel natural, even morally required, because the world has fractured. As everyone now more or less understands, people get their news from different places, with different facts (or “facts”) and very different moral narratives—crises at the border or concerning the climate, threats from woke universities or from the resurgent extreme right. Here we get a deeper picture of trust, one that is in some ways even more disturbing. Despite what the statistics about “declining trust” suggest, there is no on–off binary in which we either do or don’t trust. Trust is not like running, or drinking coffee, so that you could say, “I am not trusting today.” It is like breathing. The question is not whether you trust, but where. Only through trust can anyone ever know much of anything. Almost all of what anyone treats as knowledge is not part of their own experience, but the upshot of a social process—reporting, teaching, research, gossip—that they have decided to trust. I don’t personally know that Antarctica exists, that my vaccine works, or how many votes were cast for each candidate in 2020, and except for Antarctica, which requires only a long journey at great expense to verify, those facts are basically impossible for me to observe. When I say I know them, I mean I trust the way they came to me. I trust those who told me, and I trust how they learned what they say they know. Kimberly Wehle: The Colorado Supreme Court decision is true originalism This point, that most knowledge is indirect and social, might have seemed a philosopher’s conceit just a few decades ago. Yes, René Descartes pointed out that our lives might be illusions woven by an evil demon, and David Hume observed that just because bread tastes good today, that’s no guarantee it won’t poison you tomorrow. (Both examples have pretty clear applications to vaccine conspiracy theories.) But so what? The sun rose every day, the trains ran on time, and Walter Cronkite came on at 6:30. That complacency was the privilege of an invisible consensus, in which most people’s trust was, so to speak, facing in the same direction. Those who believe Trump’s stolen-election fables or anti-vax theories are not refusing to trust: They are trusting some other mix of reporting, research, teaching, and gossip. The polls showing collapsing trust in “newspapers” or “television news” don’t really show a decline in trust; they show a fragmentation, trust displaced. But from the perspective of a democracy that relies on a common set of facts, acute fragmentation might as well be a collapse. Some—probably a lot—of the fracture comes from social media and, before it, the rise of partisan cable and talk radio. (There is inevitably a lot of conjecture in saying what causes what in huge, interwoven changes. Let me know if you find a large and fiercely divided democracy without social media to serve as a control in this experiment.) Some of the fracture comes from social segregation: Liberals live in liberal neighborhoods, conservatives among conservatives, and education, which sorts people into workplaces, now closely tracks politics. I have worked on construction crews and university faculties, and (although my construction experience is getting out-of-date), there is a good deal less political variation in either workplace today than when I started. In addition, some of the fracture appears to be internal to politics: As the other side seems more alarming, partisans react by lining up their own opinions—about Ukraine, vaccination, immigration, whether universities are good or bad—on the side of angels. Other, more tectonic shifts are also under way. Social trust may take some support from a kind of world trust, a gut-level belief that things hold together and make good-enough sense, and that the past is a workable guide to the future. Our world trust is shaken. Consider the climate emergency. In 1946, in the aftermath of a desperate and devastating war, looking at a future shadowed by totalitarianism, George Orwell wrote about the pleasures of watching toads in April: “Spring is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.” If only. Next year, spring may be summer, and summer may be fire season not just in Oregon, but in New York and Washington, D.C. And is “Thoughts on the Common Toad” really a George Orwell essay from 1946, or did I ask ChatGPT to produce a vernal eulogy in the style of George Orwell? As it happens, it is real. But both our physical, ecological, climatic world and our communicative world of words and images are now uncertain, shifting, shimmering uncannily between what is solid and reliable and what is ontological and epistemic quicksand. Never mind whether you can trust what other people will do. Can you trust them to be other people at all? So democracy today needs people to build a trust that can survive punishing conditions. It’s no good to pine for the pre-internet world (which had plenty of problems), let alone the pre-climate-change world. And, just as tricky, what we need is not more trust exactly, but healthier trust, which, somewhat paradoxically, includes skepticism—skepticism toward those who haven’t earned our trust. Trust and skepticism, if not cynicism, are two sides of a delicate balance. The goal is not some kind of harmonious community, but for citizens of an intensely diverse country to be able to coexist in a time when our problems need political solutions; not to love one another, but to get along enough to wrestle with climate change, immigration, public safety, child care, budget deficits, war—together. What are steps toward healthier trust? Americans need ways to see one another more charitably and also to see politics more clearly. Every partisan knows the sense of threat that today’s political environment can trigger—seeing a car with a bumper sticker from the other side cut in front of you in traffic, stopping for gas somewhere you suspect everyone is on the hostile team, feeling your way through a first conversation with a dozen political trip wires. Ironically, it is impossible to practice politics if we reduce one another to our partisan identities. We need to practice nondefensively meeting serious disagreement—and proceeding to the rest of the human being. Russell Berman: Political accountability isn’t dead yet If we need to see one another more charitably, we also need to see politics a little more cynically, as an inoculation against a deeper despair. To practice politics maturely means accepting that our everyday moral judgments will not guide us in politics as surely as they do in person. A lot of political anathema takes the form of hating hypocrisy: Democrats say one thing but do another, and so do Republicans. Hating hypocrisy is natural, and in everyday life it may be a good guide to judging whom we should treat warily. But in politics, a gap between rhetoric and action is endemic, and because we can’t do without politics, we must learn to tolerate some of what will feel like hypocrisy. Politics isn’t amoral—quite the opposite—but its morality is more complex than the interpersonal kind that is everyone’s first ethical language. If we look for hypocrisy in politics, we will always find it, so treating it as fatal means death to political trust. Another distinction between personal and political trust that we need to learn involves living with sharp moral disagreement. In our own lives, we may refuse to enter close and lasting relationships with people who, say, disagree with us about questions as fundamental as how we should raise our children or what gender roles mean in our family. (I don’t mean that this is necessarily the right approach, and we may lose something when we cut ourselves off from challenge in this way, but the decision is an intelligible one.) But politics is about coexistence with disagreement around issues as fundamental as these, such as abortion. If we treat moral disagreement as proof of moral badness and as a reason, effectively, to cut off civic as well as personal relationships, then politics is done. Politics is a relationship we cannot escape, for better or worse. We can poison it, though, and confusing it with personal relationships that we can refuse or leave is one way of poisoning it. There are also structural ways to make trust less elusive. We should seek policies that make life feel less shifty and treacherous. One step would be a flat ban on AI-generated content and other such technology in advertising and sales. A sweeping moratorium on commercial uses of AI, or even AI development, would be more dramatic and, although harder to achieve, maybe more effective. Let’s not go into Descartes’ nightmare, updated as the Matrix, just because some code writers think they can build it and venture capitalists think they can use it to sell us things. We can also change the rules of daily life in more old-fashioned ways. Take the workplace. Where do young people get the sense that others will take advantage of you if they can? Partly online no doubt, but also in their life—not least at work, where many of us spend the best hours of our best years. It isn’t mysterious, really, that a very mistrustful generation is also the one pushing to unionize workplaces. And those organizing efforts also involve trust, in the form of solidarity among workers. The level of trust that it took for 8,700 Ford workers in Louisville to walk out of the Kentucky Truck plant on October 11, 2023, hours after a phone call from United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, gives the lie to any facile idea that Americans are incapable of trust. In those efforts, workers risk their job together on little more than a promise of solidarity. They have to trust one another and their elected leaders intensely. And they want to hold their bosses accountable, which is to say, make them more worthy of a healthy trust. We should recognize that having more control and responsibility—feeling more like democratic citizens—at work is part of rebuilding trust, and that some kinds of conflict, including strikes, can build valuable interpersonal trust and contribute to making institutions more trustworthy. The workplace is a microcosm of an economy where workers and many middle-class families have seen stagnation and increasing insecurity for 50 years, and fewer parents are optimistic about their children’s prospects. Economic stress is an important reason that Trump might win reelection. Beyond 2024, it’s also a lesson that the country is set up to benefit other people who don’t care about you. Countries with lower levels of economic inequality tend to have higher levels of social trust, and individuals with less money tend to be less trusting. Rebuilding a middle-class economy is a way to buttress democratic trust. Policy can also connect people across lines of ideological mistrust. Moves in federal and state government to hire workers without college degrees press back a little against the occupational and educational segregation that foster partisan bubbles. Colleges and universities can put people with very different perspectives into the same dormitories and classrooms, which may mean thinking about economic and regional diversity and conducting affirmative outreach to communities that have lost trust in higher education. And that old idealistic favorite, universal national service, is still worth trying to achieve. Nothing builds trust more successfully than doing important work with people who might otherwise be worrisome strangers. David A. Graham: America’s peace wave Each of us can also develop practices to modulate our own balance of trust and skepticism, and gently push others to do the same. Every setting is different—family, religious community, volunteering, the workplace. My job is teaching, and although a liberal is not supposed to say this, too much of what happens in the classroom assumes that everyone there has the same broadly progressive politics, and that only a fool or a jerk would disagree. This is not just a failure to welcome those who don’t agree into the conversation, all but guaranteeing that they silently dig in to whatever they already believe. It also lets down students who think of themselves as progressives, who lose the tempering of inconvenient facts, countervailing arguments, the sheer social weight of disagreement, which requires the civic and political work of argument. No one’s faith, lived experience, or personal “truth” is exempt from the burdens of conversation. At its best, sustained conversation wins converts in both directions and, more important, may transform moral horror at someone disagreeing with you into trust that people who disagree can also listen, reflect, and do things together. Cultivating strong mistrust is a way of giving up on others, a kind of quiet quitting for civic life. I wonder whether we appreciate what we are at risk of giving up. It is unusual to live in a time and place peaceful enough to lead a stable life, free enough that people can set the direction of their future together. Being born into this, none of us did anything to deserve it. But we do get to decide what to do with it. Politically engaged people feel deeply the things that are wrong with the country, and they are right. But anger and reproach are most effective when they come along with a very different set of feelings: gratitude for a country where it remains possible to do better and a sense of responsibility to build up that decent and democratic potential wherever we find it. We need to shake off the idea that democracy should come naturally. This is a superstition of the enlightened, and it serves us very badly in a time of democratic crisis. As perceptive observers have always understood, democracy is extremely demanding. It requires the qualities of mind and character that sustain a healthy and balanced political trust, such as the willingness to listen to others and to doubt one’s own side. It also requires the commitment to build a world of citizens, not just consumers or spectators or even protesters, but people who expect to exercise power and responsibility together. We will need to take control of our own future before it becomes a present we cannot stand to trust.",politics,relevant,"The article discusses the decline of trust in American society, particularly in government institutions, and the impact this has on democracy.

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/2/5/robinson-pelosi-and-the-sham-of-western-progressive-politics,"When Western politicians talk Palestine, they expose who they truly are. Politicians love to talk. It’s a big part of the job. You talk in legislatures. You talk at committees. You talk to voters. You talk to reporters. If you’re lucky, you’re asked to talk on TV, the radio, or other popular platforms. Politicians crave the attention. It’s validating. It means that you’re important. You’re a somebody with important things to say. You’re noticed. People listen. Politicians know that the bigger their job, the more careful they have to be when they’re talking to an audience – however small or large. That’s especially true if you’re a cabinet minister or a “leader”. Too much unscripted talking can be dangerous. So, more often than not, what politicians say while they’re talking is forgettable or worse, meaningless. They have to stick to their talking points. They adore cliché. Still, there are moments when politicians get too comfortable. They get complacent. They slip up and say something candid and revealing about who they are and what they actually think and believe. Fortunately, two politicians opted for refreshing bursts of honesty over the standard rhetorical gruel this past week. One is Canadian. The other is American. You probably don’t know the first politician. The second is quite well-known. Both were talking, in a roundabout way, about what is happening in Gaza. The first politician’s name is Selina Robinson. She is, as of this writing, the minister of post-secondary education in the “socialist” provincial government of British Columbia, Canada. On January 30, Robinson was talking on Zoom as part of a panel of Jewish politicians organised by a pro-Israeli advocacy group. She was among “friends”, talking to and with “friends”. In one remarkable swoop, Robinson not only rewrote history, but trafficked in a familiar racist trope. Before the engineered birth of Israel, she said, Palestine was “a crappy piece of land with nothing on it”. “There were several hundred thousand people but other than that, it didn’t produce an economy … it couldn’t grow things. It didn’t have anything on it, and that it was the folks who were displaced that came and the people who had been living there for generations and together they worked hard,” the minister said. Translation: 700,000 idle Muslim and Christian Palestinians had, for generations, squandered the chance to make the desert bloom. Happily, it flowered after the arrival of “displaced”, hard-working Israelis who “were offered” the “crappy piece of land”. Since she said what she said, Robinson has stopped talking – in public, at least. Instead, the minister has had to watch and listen to a lot of other people talking about how and why she must resign. Even the pro-Israeli outfit that invited Robinson to talk has more or less abandoned her, reportedly telling a CBC reporter that: “The comments made by Minister Robinson … do not reflect the opinion of our organization.” You know you have talked too much when your once-close “friends” cut you adrift. So, Robinson did what politicians have to do when they give fulsome voice to what they think and believe: she made a grovelling apology on X. Robinson wrote that her “flippant” and “disrespectful” comments had “caused pain”. “I regret what I said and I apologize without reservation.” Few are convinced by Robinson’s belated, performative act of contrition, including two of her “socialist” colleagues in Ottawa. One member of parliament (MP) is demanding a “reassessment” of her place in cabinet. Another MP pilloried Robinson for “an appalling disregard for the horrific violence being inflicted on Palestinians”. Robinson’s boss, the premier of British Columbia, is also talking. He said that the minister’s remarks were “wrong”. Rather than fire her, the premier is giving Robinson a good talking to. He told her, in effect, to keep talking. “She’s got some work to do to go out to the community to address the harm that her comments have caused,” he said. In other curious words, the premier wants Robinson to talk her and the government’s way out of a prickly jam. Right. That should do it. The second chatty politician is the former speaker of the US House of Representatives and the grande dame of Congressional Democrats, Nancy Pelosi. She did her troublesome talking in the ever-agreeable studios of CNN’s Washington bureau on January 29. The influential “Speaker Emerita” was asked to comment on those pesky, mostly young demonstrators who have been interrupting President Joe Biden with chants of “Genocide Joe” at campaign stops and address whether she was “concerned that they might just stay home” in the fast approaching presidential election. A condescending Pelosi promptly played the victim card, saying: “I have been the recipient of, shall we say, their exuberance in this regard … they’re in front of my house all the time.” Poor, pampered Pelosi. The “Speaker Emerita” compounded her, shall we say, disdain with a lecture, claiming that unlike the “exuberant” rabble, she and other serious types on Capitol Hill were required to “think” about “how to try to stop the suffering in Gaza”. Poor, misunderstood Pelosi. Apparently, she “thinks” that a “ceasefire” would not “stop the suffering in Gaza” since that’s what Russian President Vladimir Putin “would like to see”. Pelosi’s McCarthyite-smear-laden logic is loathsome and bizarre. What, apart from a ceasefire, is going to “stop the suffering in Gaza” – with or without Putin’s blessing? Silly, exuberant me, but I can’t “think” of anything other than a “ceasefire” that will “stop the suffering in Gaza”. Pelosi ought to have stopped talking. Thankfully, she didn’t. She then proved that behind every America-flag-pin-wearing speaker emerita, there lies an Alex Jones-like conspiracy theorist who is convinced that the homeland is awash with fifth columnists disguised as citizens exercising their constitutional rights to challenge a sitting president. “I think some of these protestors are spontaneous and organic and sincere,” Pelosi said. “Some, I think, are connected to Russia.” Again, Pelosi ought to have stopped talking. Thankfully, she didn’t. Not done tarring millions of her fellow, albeit “exuberant”, Americans of Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian descent as Putin’s useful tools, she confirmed that she is every bit as willing and eager as her nemesis, Donald Trump, to sic the FBI on perceived enemies. “Some financing should be investigated and I want to ask the FBI to investigate that,” Pelosi said. Paging J Edgar Hoover. Paging J Edgar Hoover. I’m glad Pelosi kept talking. I’m glad because she has exposed the Democratic Party for the “progressive” and “inclusive” sham that it is. The Democratic Party never has and never will be the “home” to Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian Americans. They will always be treated with suspicion and contempt by a party establishment that confuses dissent with disloyalty and considers Palestinians disposable fodder.

VIÑA DEL MAR, Chile — Sebastián Piñera, the two-time former president of Chile who faced social upheaval followed by a pandemic in his second term, died Tuesday in a helicopter accident. He was 74. Chile Interior Minister Carolina Tohá confirmed the death of the former president. No further details were immediately released about the cause of the accident. Serving as president from 2010 to 2014 and again from 2018 to 2022, he led the South American nation during devastating natural disasters, including the fallout of an earthquake and a tsunami. He also governed during the coronavirus pandemic and placed Chile among the top five countries for vaccination rates for the illness. His legacy is marred by violent police repression in October 2019 against protesters who were demonstrating against the country's education, health and pension systems dating to the country's 1973-1990 military dictatorship. International organizations cited mass violations of human rights in the crackdown. The social unrest ultimately led to two attempts to update the constitution inherited from the military government, but both have failed. Piñera was the owner of the fifth largest fortune in Chile, estimated at some 3 billion dollars. He worked as an academic in several universities for almost 20 years and as a consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. As a businessman in the 1970s through the 1990s, he worked in a variety of industries, including real estate. He held shares in major airlines, telecommunication, real estate and electricity companies. He also created one of the largest credit card companies in the country. In 2009, he handed over the management of his businesses to others. He entered politics representing the center-right, which was the civilian support of the military regime. However, when he served as an independent senator, he voted against the extension of dictator Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). He ran three times for president of Chile. In 2006, he lost to socialist Michelle Bachelet; then in 2010 he defeated former President Eduardo Frei and was elected in 2010. Four years later, in 2018, he won a second four-year term after defeating a leftist independent. Twelve days before the beginning of his first term, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami claimed the lives of 525 people and devastated the infrastructure of central-southern Chile. Piñera's government agenda was postponed in order to take on emergency reconstruction. In 2010, he also led the unprecedented rescue of 33 miners trapped for 69 days at the bottom of a mine, which captured the world's attention. He closed his administration having created an estimated 1 million jobs.

https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies,"Filed under: You don’t just vote for Trump. You stan him. It’s a common observation that modern-day politics increasingly resembles fandom: Both feature communities created around and united by passion, and both are often heavily fixated on a single public figure. Many pundits are now calling right-wing voters “the Trump fandom,” as though there’s little difference between a Trumpist who flocks to a political rally and a member of the Beyhive snapping up seats to Coachella. Drawing general parallels between the two movements can seem easy, even simplistic, but when we look closer, what we find are mutually thorny, mutually complex ideological ecosystems with telling overlap. In both subcultures, the rise of social media echo chambers has fomented toxicity, extremism, and delusional thinking. For instance, you may not think there’s any link between QAnon and the belief that this Chinese actor is a hologram, but they both arise from the same basic problems: disinformation and zealotry serving to distort and fracture our shared sense of reality, all in the name of what devotees believe to be a higher cause. Passionate enthusiasts have existed throughout human history, but fans who identify as “part of fandom” move within larger communities of other actively engaged fans. The word “fan” came into popular use in the late 1880s, with “fandom” surfacing around 1903. The concept flourished in niche geek and sports communities throughout the 20th century, and finally found its way into the mainstream in the aughts and ’10s thanks to the rise of the internet. While fandom was evolving online in the 2000s, organic political movements were growing more commonplace, with very similar dynamics. At their core, fandom and politics both require emotion, with all the intensity that implies. Fandoms were collectives of people drawn together by their emotional attachment to specific sports teams, creatives, or works of media. Grassroots political movements of the aughts, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, were localized collectives initially drawn together by a shared narrative of what they wanted their country to become. That communal narrative is crucial connective tissue between politics and fandom; it unites people around not just a shared sense of identity, but a shared story and the idea that they’re building that story together. These narratives aren’t just entertainment. To their proponents, they have a higher moral purpose, whether it’s “draining the swamp,” rooting for your favorite characters in a series to get together, or freeing Taylor Swift from the oppression of the closet. Big fandom narratives often segue into big political ones: Several fandom projects of the early internet spawned offshoot social and political movements, like Fandom Forward, which began as the Harry Potter Alliance, and Project for Awesome, an offshoot of the Vlogbrothers fandom. Both groups encourage fans toward social change. A single piece of Harry Potter fanfiction is arguably responsible for popularizing the Effective Altruism movement. Trump’s political rise coincides with a specific substrain of intense celebrity fandom that emerged in the new millennium. The “stan,” sometimes referred to collectively as “standom,” is an ironic term borrowed from Eminem’s 2000 song “Stan,” about a stalker fan whose obsession goes too far. The concept of “stanning” was hugely shaped by Twitter’s ability to allow fans to follow their faves in real time, commune with other fans, and even talk directly to the creators they stanned. It hardly seems coincidental that during the era when celebrities and pop stars became more immediately interactive with their fanbases, Trump successfully styled himself not as a politician, but as a celebrity who deigned to do politics just to satisfy his long-suffering fans. By pretending that he didn’t need politics but politics needed him, Trump established the idea that his political participation was not self-serving, but rather a conduit for the frustrations of his followers. From the outset, he presented himself as a vessel for their beliefs. As one Trump supporter recently told MSNBC’s Garrett Haake, “When Trump is facing all these things, he’s doing it for us in our place.” But the idea of Trump as a conduit works both ways. If you wanted to see political change, you couldn’t just vote for Trump; you had to transfer your emotional investment from politics at large onto him individually. You had to stan him. When stans call themselves “stans,” it’s a wryly self-deprecating label that implies plenty of self-awareness on the fans’ parts about the tricky relationship they have with their idols. It also predicts the slippery slope that can result when fans’ investment in their faves gets too intense. Increasingly, however, there are fewer self-aware stopgaps in modern celebrity fandom, and, as January 6 taught us, even fewer in politics. Applying the concept of a shared narrative to political activism imbues that activism with all the heady intoxication of a fantasy role-playing game, whether it’s a fantasy of progress or a fantasy of extremism. In his recently republished 2007 book Dream: Reimagining Progressive Politics in an Age of Fantasy (now retitled Dream or Nightmare), author Stephen Duncombe observed that Trump won the 2016 election not based on facts — he lied often — but upon his ability to create fantasy masked as truth. “Facts, it seems, are not things that are verifiably true or false, merely components in a story,” Duncombe notes. “Over the past decade, right-wing populists from Israel to India, all throughout Europe and the UK, have been inventing facts to fill in fantasies of national greatness, and imminent destruction, in their rise to power.” This distortion of reality is partly inadvertent slippage. After all, when all your friends are playing the RPG with you, it can be hard to re-enter reality. And when all your friends are creating the narrative with you, it can be hard to remember what parts are real and what parts you constructed together. The narrative predetermines not only what information you receive, but how you interpret it and order it within the larger story. As Duncombe writes, “We understand our world less through reasoned deliberation of facts, and more through stories and symbols and metaphors.” Received in a community of devotees, such stories and symbols often morph into esoteric codes only true believers can see, from “Q drops” to signs that Louis Tomlinson’s baby is fake. And as with intensely held religious beliefs, such communities tend to double down on their beliefs once challenged or proven inaccurate rather than rethink them. In fandom communities where this happens, we see groups collectively rejecting a more measured version of reality in favor of intense conspiracy theories to support their big narratives, again and again and again and again and again. In both fandom and politics, these distortions are often also intentionally exacerbated by community leaders. Influential members can manipulate their followers by deliberately twisting or omitting facts to suit the narrative they prefer or the narrative that’s most advantageous to their larger agenda. Their role as a translator of reality to their followers can’t be overstated. Media researcher Sarah Banet-Weiser, in the recently published Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, observes that while it’s common to worry we’ve entered a fractured, “post-truth” era, the idea of “truth” itself has always been highly contextual. Moreover, truth in various contexts relies on who’s telling it: “It [depends] on the assumption that certain actors tell the truth, and that these actors have been authorized with the mantle of veracity in their understandings of the world and of themselves.” When we’re emotionally invested not only in the narrative being bolstered by the truth-teller but in the chosen truth-teller themselves, it becomes even harder to extricate an “objective” version of reality from the version they’re dispensing because the stakes feel so high. These believers aren’t above engaging in what internet researcher Alice Marwick has termed “morally motivated networked harassment”: the simple yet profound concept that being part of an ideologically driven community allows believers to justify even the most toxic behaviors, even if their ideology is unusual and a bystander wouldn’t understand their motivations or goals as moralistic. Left to themselves, most of the people who sieged the Capitol on January 6 would probably never have been instigators; as part of a larger collective being egged on by their leader, however, they came to feel fully justified even in acts as extreme as insurrection. While Trump’s stage is the political arena, his aims and tools are about his celebrity, not his politics. “Trump was not using tools of entertainment to appear a better politician,” Duncombe writes. “He was using politics as a better stage for his performance as an entertainer.” You might wonder what celebrity qualities Trump has that allow him to influence his followers to this extent; after all, he’s no Beyoncé. But, as Trump himself is extremely aware, he doesn’t have to be — he only has to encourage his followers to make him into whatever they want him to be. The public figure’s persona is a collectively created construct. It’s built by the celebrity and what they present to the media and the public, and then built by the media and the public and how they interpret and interact with the famous person. Once fans have created a personal parasocial relationship with their celebrity of choice, they will project whatever positive attributes they want onto that celebrity’s persona — even if they don’t align with reality and even if they’re internally contradictory. The secret of Trump’s following isn’t that Trump unlocked the be-all and end-all of political campaigning, but rather that he understands how his public persona works. From the outset, he encouraged his followers to project their own desires and fantasies onto him. “Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people,” he said in his party nomination acceptance speech in 2016. “I am your voice.” While some stars offend their fans by refusing to play into their narratives — see, for example, Taylor Swift battling the gaylors — Trump remains unflappable in the face of any and all interpretations of his persona. By enabling his fans to project their anxieties and hopes onto him, Trump inflated his public persona to a degree that has become completely divorced from the man himself and completely bulletproof. “Trump is our David and our Goliath,” an Iowa voter recently told the New York Times. Not even Beyoncé has range like that. This level of idolatry seems to have shifted Trump’s fandom beyond relatively normal parasocial relationships. Trump lost the 2016 Iowa caucus to Ted Cruz, largely because Cruz courted evangelical voters who were uneasy about Trump’s extreme nationalist politics. In 2024, after he handily won the same state, columnists like Amanda Marcotte and Sarah Posner pointed out that he seems to have usurped the role once held by leaders of the religious right to become a religious idol himself. This certainly wouldn’t be the first time a celebrity has been compared to a religious figure, but the existential and blatantly fascist threat to democracy presented by this development can’t be overstated. Trump already holds sway over his followers’ fantasies, and he already determines how (or whether) they receive facts and information. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that portrayals of Trump as a near-deity will fuel an even sharper divide — an ever-widening gap between how his supporters view reality, America, and his place in it, and what the rest of us see and experience.

https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/22/nikki-haley-gender-gop-trump-00137060,"2024 Elections Nikki Haley is testing the limits of how much GOP primary voters care about gender. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley takes photos with supporters at a campaign event in Seabrook, New Hampshire. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO By Natalie Allison 01/22/2024 05:57 PM EST Link Copied NASHUA, New Hampshire — Nikki Haley has already gone further than any Republican woman before her who ran for president. For months, she has joked about the high heels she wears, and, without fail, blasts a post-rally soundtrack of “American Girl” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Sheryl Crow’s “Woman in the White House.” In every early nominating and Super Tuesday state, Haley has established a “Women for Nikki” chapter — groups of female volunteers who urge their friends and neighbors, including those who are not ordinarily politically active, to get behind the former South Carolina governor. But with Haley running behind Donald Trump by 
double digits in New Hampshire, and only 
polling about even with him among women — she is also testing the limits of how much voters care. “It was bad enough, they elected him the first time,” said Thalia Floras, a 61-year-old Haley supporter from Nashua, who changed her voter registration this fall from Democrat to undeclared. “But this time, they know what they got. And they’re doing it again.” Haley held a Get Out The Vote Rally with Judge Judy in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Jan. 21.

Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO As Haley has campaigned here over the past week, a galling reality has settled in on supporters who saw her candidacy as a step forward for women in politics. Not only was she trailing. She was losing to the man who famously won despite his “grab ‘em” and “blood coming out of her wherever” remarks in 2016 — and seems to be cruising to the nomination even after a jury found him liable for sexual assault and defamation, accusations Trump has denied. “That’s my biggest fear, that he gets in. The way he has spoken about women …” Kathy Kelley, a 69-year-old retired educator from Hudson, said at a Haley event over the weekend, trailing off and shaking her head. “I still can’t watch Billy Bush.” Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former U.N. ambassador, is unique among women in even making it to New Hampshire in a competitive position. The handful of Republican women who ran for president before her weren’t real players in the state’s contest. In 2016, Carly Fiorina earned just 4 percent in the New Hampshire primary, after finishing seventh-place in Iowa and netting a single delegate. Michele Bachmann dropped out of the race after coming in sixth place in the Iowa caucuses in 2012, failing to earn any delegates. In the 2000 GOP primary, Elizabeth Dole suspended her campaign before competing in any of the early nominating states. And Haley is highlighting her womanhood. On Sunday, moments after learning Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had ended his presidential bid, she sketched out the dynamics of the Republican race in the simplest of terms: a fight, she said, between “one fella and one lady.” Then, playing to her gender, she told supporters in a Seabrook restaurant, “May the best woman win.” People line up outside of the Franklin, New Hampshire VFW to hear Haley speak on Jan. 22.

Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO “It’s definitely not only a part of an electoral coalition, but it’s also a part of the energy and momentum and movement behind the campaign,” said Betsy Ankney, Haley’s campaign manager. And it is in part because Haley is a woman that Democrats fear her in a general election. They worry that her politics and her profile would be far more appealing to suburban women who had fled the Republican party in the Trump years. Haley is relying on some of that same demographic to power her primary campaign, especially in New Hampshire, where independents make up a large portion of the primary electorate. Part of her appeal is on the issue of abortion. In interviews at recent Haley campaign events in New Hampshire, nearly a dozen attendees brought up her moderate rhetoric on the subject, compared to much of the rest of the Republican field. Haley describes herself as a “pro-life” candidate who refuses to “judge” anyone for their stance on abortion. Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said Haley faces a dilemma on abortion in a GOP primary. But she doesn’t believe Haley went far enough to champion women’s rights in a way that would win over the state’s women and centrist voters. “She did better than I’ve ever seen any other Republican talk about it,” said Horn, who now considers herself an independent voter, speaking to reporters at a roundtable hosted by Bloomberg. “But she’s just not there … I think that that is a single issue that could have positioned her much better” in New Hampshire. On Sunday, moments after learning Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had ended his presidential bid, she told supporters in a Seabrook restaurant, “May the best woman win.”

Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO Haley is making other overt appeals to women. On Monday, her campaign aired a three-minute TV ad across the state that they acknowledged has a particular appeal to women as they seek to boost her coalition of independent voters here in the GOP primary. The ad features Cindy Warmbier, whose son Otto died after being imprisoned in North Korea, praising Haley — how the country’s then-United Nations ambassador sent personal text messages and emails checking in on the Warmbiers, promising “she would do everything she could to make sure the world never forgot Otto.” “She did it as a mom, a friend, and a fighter who made my fight her own,” Warmbier said in the ad. Ankney, who described herself as “not much of a crier,” said she shed a tear when she watched the final cut of the ad. “I think that the response to that has already been pretty overwhelming,” Ankney said on Saturday, when it had only been released online. “Particularly among women and among independent voters.” A young Haley supporter cheers during a Get Out The Vote Rally in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Jan. 21.

Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO Haley herself, despite talking about her heels, or being a mother to her now-adult children, or knowing how to discuss controversial issues better than “the fellas,” has repeatedly said she resists identity politics. “To be honest, I think other people think about it a lot more than we do,” Ankney said. As Haley campaigned across the state here this week, voters largely said in interviews that her gender was not the most important reason they were behind her. But it is a compelling reason for some, even if they sensed it wouldn’t be enough. A day after Trump seemed to confuse Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying Haley was in charge of Capitol security on Jan. 6, 2021, Kori Garnhart, a 19-year-old student at Franklin Pierce, sat listening to Haley at a rally at her university. She said she was drawn to Haley in part because it was empowering to see a female candidate and inspiring to witness the possibility of a woman president. But she recognized she isn’t necessarily in the majority. Even if it is “a plus” today for her generation, she said, in today’s politics, “some people might see it as a bad thing.” Or just not motivating enough to draw them away from Trump. “I just feel like so many of the older Americans are still not ready,” said Lisa Tracy, a voter from Salem. “And it’s ridiculous.” Link Copied © 2024 POLITICO LLC",politics,relevant,"Nikki Haley is testing the limits of how much GOP primary voters care about gender in the 2024 elections.

Haley's moderate stance on abortion is seen as appealing to some voters, but she faces challenges in championing women's rights.

https://www.businessinsider.com/iowa-trump-first-time-caucusgoers-evangelicals-haley-desantis-2016-gop-2024-1,"       Former President Donald Trump has long boasted enviable leads over his GOP challengers in polling for the Iowa caucuses, but his appeal with first-time caucusgoers and evangelical voters has put him in a class by himself a day before voting begins. In the final NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll released on Saturday, Trump was backed by 48% of likely GOP voters in Iowa, with former UN ambassador Nikki Haley at 20% support, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 16%, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at 8%. Trump's 48% mark represents some minor slippage from last month's poll, where the former president earned 51% support among GOP caucusgoers. However, the final GOP caucus poll still shows Trump nearly 30 points ahead of Haley, and the former president has majority support among both first-time caucusgoers (56%) and evangelical Christians (51%) — with a stratospheric 88% of his supporters stating that they're extremely enthusiastic about his candidacy. Trump is in the best position he's ever been in for a contested GOP caucus in Iowa. The 2016 caucus results provide a measure of just how much the former president has throttled his competition this time around. In 2016, Trump was still new to GOP politics, but he needed no introduction to the American public after his years as a celebrity businessman. At first glance, Trump's brash personality seemed ill-suited for Iowa, known for its Midwestern sensibilities and, until recently, its status as one of the nation's most recognizable swing states. But despite Trump's second-place finish in the 2016 caucuses to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, he still performed better than a slate of more established GOP candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had long been seen as the presumed frontrunner before his campaign ultimately fell apart. In 2016, Cruz edged out Trump 28%-24% in Iowa, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in third place with 23% support. (Bush came in sixth place with roughly 3% support.) In that contest, Cruz edged out Trump among evangelicals 34%-22%, with Rubio close behind at 21% support. And polling showed that evangelicals comprised roughly 64% of the GOP caucus electorate that year. If Trump wins a majority of the evangelical vote on Monday and they turn out in similar numbers to 2016, he'll more than likely be the runaway victor in the contest. DeSantis in the final Iowa pre-caucus poll of 2024 attracted the support of 22% of evangelicals, an overperformance compared to his overall 16% share of support among likely GOP caucusgoers. The Florida governor has staked his campaign on a strong showing in Iowa, so the stakes are higher for him in rallying this group to give him a fighting chance to beat out Haley for the second-place slot. Ahead of Monday, Trump continues to benefit from his strength with GOP voters overall, including those who haven't participated in a caucus before. The former president won first-time GOP caucusgoers in 2016, earning 30% of their vote compared to Cruz's 23% support. The former president's 56% support with this group is nearly double his support from eight years ago. These benefits are adding up for Trump in a major way as he looks to win Iowa and march to the GOP presidential nomination.

https://www.businessinsider.com/lawyer-claims-trump-used-coded-version-c-word-insult-her-2024-2,"       A lawyer who represented writer E. Jean Carroll against Donald Trump claimed that the former president once used a coded version of the C-word profanity against her. Kaplan's allegation is the latest accusation of Trump's use of misogynistic language toward women. Roberta Kaplan said that the incident occurred at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort at the end of a deposition for an unrelated case before she went on to help Carroll win $86.3 million in damages. Kaplan said on an episode of ""George Conway Explains it All (to Sarah Longwell)"" podcast that Trump's attorneys made sure that they were off the record before he said: ""See you next Tuesday."" The phrase is commonly known as a euphemism for a derogatory four-letter word referring to female genitalia. Kaplan told Conway that she initially didn't understand what Trump meant because they were not scheduled to meet the following Tuesday. ""I, thank God, had no idea what that meant, so I said to him, 'What are you talking about? I'm coming back on Wednesday,'"" Kaplan said. ""Literally, it was an honest answer. I had no idea what he's talking about."" A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, which was made outside regular working hours. This matters as Trump has long faced accusations that he speaks about women in a derogatory and sexist way, ranging from his notorious ""grab 'em by the pussy"" comment to other demeaning remarks about women made in public and reportedly in private. One of his most egregious remarks was about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who he said had ""blood coming out of her wherever"" at a Republican presidential debate in 2015. During the debate, Kelly had pressed Trump about misogynistic, sexist comments he made in the past, such as calling some women ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals."" Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutger's University, previously told the BBC that Trump's insulting language about high-profile women is part of a pattern. ""The kind of things that he said about Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina, Elizabeth Warren, Heidi Cruz — the list goes on — he talks about women, any prominent, powerful woman, in the most demeaning of ways, trivializing them."" Of course, Trump is known to attack all of his rivals and perceived enemies viciously, regardless of gender, but his language toward women is often distinct. Professor Marianne LaFrance, a psychologist at Yale University, previously told the BBC that Trump often uses gendered language when insulting women — such as by referring to diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, not by name, but as ""the woman."" In the same podcast episode, Kaplan revealed that Trump ""yelled"" at his attorney Alina Habba, and threw documents ""across the table"" in fury after finding out Kaplan and her team had been offered lunch at Mar-a-Lago.

https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-patriot-missile-supply-from-the-us-could-soon-dry-up-2024-1,"       The White House and the Pentagon have warned that the supply of Patriot interceptor missiles may soon be unsustainable due to their substantial cost of around $2 million to $4 million each, The New York Times reported. As Russia intensifies its winter bombardment with a diverse range of missiles and drone weapons, Ukrainian defenses are reliant on Patriot missiles, which have proven to be highly effective against Putin's top weapons. On Tuesday, Ukraine said it shot down all 10 of the new Kinzhals fired during a vicious air assault, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine praising the incident as ""what heroism supplied with advanced systems looks like."" Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said the Kinzhal missile was an ""undefeatable"" system. ""Given that the Patriot is one of the few systems that can effectively shoot down ballistic missiles, and ballistic missiles cause the most casualties, I think the number of lives saved during the war is in the thousands,"" Volodymyr, a Ukrainian major, told The New York Times. All Ukraine's Patriot interceptors have so far been strategically placed around Kyiv to protect the capital, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, per Politico, adding that he would like at least ""a dozen"" more to protect other key cities like Kherson and Odesa. Russia has increased its missile attacks against its neighbor in the hopes of further depleting its dwindling Patriot stocks. Jade McGlynn, a Russian politics researcher and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told Business Insider that depleting Patriot stocks was ""clearly part of"" Russia's strategy. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has endured over 3,800 drones and 7,400 missiles directed at its towns and cities, The NYT reported. The range of attacks has meant Ukraine has turned into a trial area for different air-defense systems, ranging from truck-mounted Stingers to the advanced French-designed SAMP/T. The Patriots, designed to counter ballistic missiles, stand out in their ability to intercept incoming attacks. Yet, the unpredictability of future missile supplies leaves Ukrainian commanders uncertain about their defensive capabilities. The Biden administration's request for a further $61 billion in aid for Ukraine has been stalled by Republicans in US Congress, who are demanding the military support comes with stricter US-Mexico border controls. But while Congress threatens future Patriot supplies, it is hoped NATO can fill the gap if the US supply dries up. Countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain could help provide up to 1,000 Patriot missiles to the wartorn country, The Associated Press reported. The contract could be worth around $5.5 billion, per The AP.

https://www.businessinsider.com/chip-roy-thomas-massie-trump-desantis-endorsements-fear-2024-1,"       The majority of former President Donald Trump's support in Congress is driven by fear of Republican voters, according to two House Republicans. Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — both of whom are staunch conservatives and backers of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — claimed as much in recent interviews with The New York Times. ""I would say a good number of the people who have endorsed Trump in Congress have done it because they genuinely want him to be the president and they prefer him,"" Massie told the Times. ""But a majority of them are scared of their own constituents. Not necessarily scared of Trump, but that he would rile up their constituents and that they might lose a primary. And that is disappointing to me."" ""Frankly,"" Roy told The Times, ""all too many of my Republican colleagues operate out of fear. I fear the Lord. I don't fear politics. I don't fear political retribution. Worst-case scenario, I end up back in Texas? My life is pretty good."" Trump now boasts close to 100 House Republican endorsements, including the entire top brass of House Republican leadership. The former president recently sought to encourage a primary challenge to Roy, who he dubbed a ""Republican in Name Only."" But he did so more than a week after the filing deadline. Both men have shown a willingness to buck their party, and not just on the matter of who should be their presidential standard-bearer. Massie, for example, is generally an opponent of all foreign aid, including to Israel, and he has voted against some recent pro-Israel bills in the House. And both Roy and Massie were in the minority of House Republicans who voted to certify the results of the 2020 election, angering Trump. ""I have the Trump antibodies,"" Massie told The Times. ""I've been attacked, built a resistance in my district."" Trump, meanwhile, is beginning to stew about Republicans who have refused to back his 2024 campaign. He recently warned that both Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri ""must be very careful"" in their 2024 reelection campaigns, prompting Hawley to quickly endorse the former president. But Cruz — who used to employ Roy as his chief of staff — has continued to hold out. ""Ted — he shouldn't even exist,"" Trump has reportedly said. ""I could've destroyed him. I kind of did destroy him in 2016, if you think about it. But then I let him live."" Next Monday, Trump will face his first key electoral test since 2020, competing against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Ambassador Nikki Haley and others at the Iowa Caucuses. Read next Jump to",politics,relevant,The article discusses how many House Republicans who support former President Donald Trump do so out of fear of their constituents rather than genuine preference for Trump. Reps. Chip Roy and Thomas Massie expressed disappointment in their colleagues' reliance on fear rather than principle. Both men have shown a willingness to go against their party on various issues. Trump has close to 100 House Republican endorsements but is beginning to express frustration with those who have not backed his 2024 campaign.

https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-indict-biden-courts-immunity-2024-1,"       Former President Donald Trump says federal courts better give him total immunity from criminal prosecution — or he'll go after Joe Biden if he wins this year. ""If I don't get Immunity, then Crooked Joe Biden doesn't get Immunity,"" Trump wrote in an early-morning post on his social media site. Trump — the GOP frontrunner for 2024 who lost to Biden in 2020 — has promised to go to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to hear his lawyers argue that he should have blanket immunity. The former president has repeatedly threatened and at times pushed to jail his political opponents, dating back to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. In recent weeks, Trump has shown a tendency to embrace authoritarian rhetoric. He even went so far as to tease that he would be a ""dictator"" only on ""day one"" of his potential return to the White House. It's not entirely clear what Trump means by his threat since presidents don't hand down indictments. In all federal criminal cases, a grand jury must be empaneled and agree to move forward with the charges. That being said, the former president has historically favored a level of involvement in the judicial branch that calls into question the fundamental values of the separation of power and the rule of law that Americans hold so dear. Trump is facing four criminal cases this year as he runs again for the presidency, including allegations he tried to remain in power after losing the 2020 election, as well as mishandled classified documents and obstructed the government's attempts to get them back. Trump and his lawyers have argued that the former president's plan to get Congress to throw out the election results was part of his job as president, meaning his actions can't be criminal. ""I was looking for voter fraud, and finding it, which is my obligation to do, and otherwise running running our Country,"" Trump wrote, continuing to spread his election lies (Trump's allegations of widespread voter fraud have been thrown out of court). Trump says Biden would be next if his own cases aren't dropped. ""By weaponizing the DOJ against his Political Opponent, ME, Joe has opened a giant Pandora's Box,"" Trump wrote. Trump has argued without any evidence that the criminal cases against him are being ordered by Biden and his administration to target him. Special Counsel Jack Smith called those accusations false. Smith recently asked a judge to order Trump to leave politics out of court, raising concerns that jurors might acquit him, even if they know he's guilty. It is worth pointing out that the same Justice Department is currently investigating Hunter Biden, the president's son.

He has accused Biden of targeting him with these cases, but these accusations have been denied by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Smith has requested that Trump refrain from bringing politics into the courtroom to ensure a fair trial. The article highlights Trump's attempts to avoid legal consequences and his willingness to target political opponents."

Before DeSantis could begin a speech to voters holding their GOP caucus on January 15, a prankster interrupted to present the Florida governor with a ""participation trophy"" for his long shot presidential campaign. ""Gov. DeSantis, I want to present to you this participation trophy,"" Davram Stiefler of the prankster duo ""The Good Liars"" said, eliciting laughter from the crowd. ""Now you're probably not going to win the election, right? But we're proud of you for trying."" The GOP presidential hopeful's smile wavered as he tried to get Stiefler to move on, pushing away the trophy and saying ""I don't do participation trophies, sorry buddy. Sorry buddy."" Ron DeSantis receives a participation trophy with campaigning in Atlantic, IA. pic.twitter.com/3YR6QM5OTG DeSantis' wife, Casey, motioned at security to escort him out. As they led him away, Stiefler continued addressing the room: ""He's special, he's unique, and he's our little snowflake."" Stiefler and representatives for the DeSantis campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. ""The Good Liars,"" the pranksters who called Trump boring to his face, trolled NRA leader Wayne LaPierre for offering ""thoughts and prayers"" in response to mass shootings, wore a ""Settle for Biden"" shirt to a 2020 Biden campaign event, and snuck an empty ""classified"" folder into a display case at Trump Tower amid Trump's document case, then paid a visit to a Vivek Ramaswamy event for more hijinks. On Sunday, Ramaswamy's campaign stop in Ankeny, Iowa, was disrupted when Stiefler and his comedic companion, Jason Selvig, interrupted Ramswamy's speech. Though it's unclear exactly how the altercation started, a video that began midway through the incident shows Stiefler saying, ""I love you. I love all of you. That's the thing about me,"" USA Today reported. Ramaswamy told the pair they could participate in a scheduled Q&A if they respected the ""norms"" of the event and, if they didn't, should ""get the hell out,"" the video shows. The entrepreneur-turned-political candidate then encouraged his audience to ""let these people know what you think of them,"" eliciting a round of jeers from the crowd as Stiefler and Selvig were escorted from the event. ""This is why we need to get the super PAC out of American politics,"" Ramaswamy called out as the duo were removed from the event, though the satirists aren't associated with political fundraising groups. ""End the super PAC and end the corruption. We're sick and tired of it. The other candidates are threatened.""

https://www.businessinsider.com/mayorkas-biden-immigration-migrants-us-mexico-border-trump-gop-impeachment-2024-2,"       Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas rejected the notion that President Joe Biden's early immigration moves caused a surge in migrants at the US-Mexico border in a recent interview. While speaking with The New York Times Magazine, Mayorkas, who has repeatedly clashed with congressional Republicans during his tenure, said the Biden administration's desire to pivot away from many of former President Donald Trump's most draconian immigration policies didn't cause a humanitarian crisis at the border. ""I think that people leave their homes because of the conditions under which they suffer,"" Mayorkas told the Times. ""I will say that if one wants to speak of rhetoric and the message it sends, what do you think the message is when a politician stands up and says the border is open, which it isn't?"" he continued. When Mayorkas was asked if he was referring to Trump and many of the former president's most ardent conservative allies, he concurred. ""Correct. And that is both inaccurate and harmful,"" he said. ""Those words are then taken by the smugglers that exploit the vulnerable. They know how to reach desperate people, and they use those words as truth to drive human behavior."" Since Biden has been in office, Mayorkas has become the face of Republican frustrations over the president's immigration policies, with scores of GOP lawmakers calling for the US-Mexico border to shut down as the country in recent years has struggled with a surge in illegal crossings. In December 2023, illegal border crossings from Mexico resulted in a record monthly high of nearly 250,000 arrests, according to US Border Patrol. The figure represented a 13% increase from the roughly 222,000 arrests in December 2022. The illegal border crossings have become a major political vulnerability for Biden, who has signed on to a bipartisan border bill that could pass the Senate but would face stiff resistance from House Republicans. Trump, who has made immigration a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, has encouraged Republicans to scuttle the bipartisan effort. House Republicans dramatically escalated their campaign to oust Mayorkas from his position this week. On Wednesday, the GOP-controlled Homeland Security Committee voted to send impeachment articles to the House for a vote, castigating the secretary for what they've long alleged is his refusal to enforce existing immigration laws. Mayorkas slammed the impeachment effort as ""baseless"" and rejected what he said was a political impetus behind the impeachment vote. ""I am not engaged in politics,"" he told the Times. ""I'm engaged in the work of the Department of Homeland Security.""

https://www.businessinsider.com/powell-60-minutes-interview-fed-interest-rate-cuts-before-election-2024-2,"       In a ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the Federal Reserve's December 2023 forecasts for three interest rate cuts this year remain the same. In December, participants in a meeting held by the Federal Open Market Committee predicted three cuts for 2024, bringing interest rates down to 4.6%. Powell told ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Scott Pelley that those forecasts remain. ""I will say, though, nothing has happened in the meantime that would lead me to think that people would dramatically change their forecasts,"" Powell said when asked if the cuts to 4.6% are still likely. Powell did not explicitly provide a timeline, but Pelley noted during the broadcast that the first cut could come in the ""middle of the year, few months before the election"" in November. The Associated Press reported that most economists have predicted that the cuts can come as early as May or June. Bank of America said on Thursday that cuts likely won't come until June. During a Wednesday presser, Powell also spilled cold water on any expectations that cuts would come as early as March. ""If the economy were to weaken, then we could reduce rates earlier and perhaps faster. If the economy were to prove — if inflation were to prove more persistent, that could call for us to reduce rates later and perhaps slower,"" Powell said, according to a transcript of the ""60 Minutes"" interview. ""So, it really is going to be dependent on the incoming data as that affects the outlook."" Since July, the Fed interest rate has sat at 5.25% to 5.5%. But despite a strong labor market and cooling inflation, Powell said in the interview that the Fed wants to see ""more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%"" to make interest rate cuts sooner. In a Friday interview with Fox News, Donald Trump said that Powell was going to make interest rate cuts this year ""to probably help the Democrats,"" adding, ""It looks to me like he's trying to lower interest rates for the sake of maybe getting people elected."" But Powell insisted during the ""60 Minutes"" interview that the Fed's decisions are apolitical. ""We do not consider politics in our decisions. We never do. And we never will,"" Powell said, adding that ""integrity is priceless. And at the end, that's all you have. And we plan on keeping ours.""

https://www.businessinsider.com/failing-to-confront-trump-may-be-reason-his-challengers-fail-2024-1,"       Now that the dust has finally settled from Wednesday night's dueling events — a town hall featuring former President Donald Trump and a GOP presidential debate between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — one thing appears all but certain: by refusing to confront Trump in person before the Iowa Caucus, each of his competitors dug their campaign's own graves. As it currently stands in an average of national GOP primary polls, Trump's currently ahead of the pack by 48.3 percentage points, a seemingly insurmountable lead. The former president's lead has become steadily higher in the months after he decided not to appear at any of the primary debates ahead of the Iowa Caucus, effectively eliminating any opportunity for his opponents to attack him on stage and in person. ""Why would I allow people at 1 or 2 percent and 0 percent to be hitting me with questions all night?"" Trump said in June 2023, several months before the first GOP debate. Skipping out on each of the debates (and running his own counter-programming to many of them) may have irked the GOP internally, but in hindsight, it certainly seems like he made the right decision. While it made sense at the time for Trump's competitors to attend the first few debates and establish their stances and public speaking abilities, none of them were bold enough to step away and act unpredictably, or skip any of the debates, just as the former president has done. Stunts have a vibrant and celebrated history in American presidential politics, and underdogs have relied on all sorts of unconventional and guerrilla tactics to make swipes at top contenders. So why have these underdogs played the primary entirely on Trump's terms? Why not make a single gamble when down 50 points to force an issue? Instead of attending one of the last few debates — each of which has received markedly less viewership than the one before — why not try and pull a stunt by showing up in person at Trump's town hall? The event was hosted by Fox News, which likely would've been more than willing to let a major candidate attempt to stand up to the former commander-in-chief. Sure, that idea may very well have been a better fit for ""The West Wing"" than reality, but when the sole alternative is running a traditional campaign and trailing by more than 40 percentage points, one of the campaigns needed to do something unconventional to go after Trump. Nevertheless, not a single one did. Though former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson each ran campaigns predicated on fighting against Trump and brought their distaste for him to the debate stage, Christie dropped out of the race before the debate on Wednesday and Hutchinson's polling less than one percentage point nationally. They may have gone against the grain with their admonition of Trump, but neither of the two campaigns took any other unconventional risks that could've propelled them any further. Instead, by playing it safe pre-Iowa Caucus, if Trump wins, his opponents and their campaigns need only look internally as to why. Read next Jump to",politics,relevant,"The article discusses how former President Donald Trump's decision to not participate in GOP debates before the Iowa Caucus has given him a significant lead in the polls, with his competitors failing to confront him directly on stage.

The lack of bold actions by Trump's opponents may result in their campaigns failing if Trump wins the primary."
https://www.businessinsider.com/houthis-retain-offensive-power-despite-us-led-airstrikes-report-2024-1,"       The Houthi rebels retain around 75% of their missile- and drone-firing capabilities despite US-led attacks against the group in Yemen earlier this week, The New York Times reported, citing US officials. Army Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims II, the director of operations of the Joint Staff, seemed confident on Friday that the US and the UK strikes had achieved their intended goal of disrupting the Houthi's offensive capabilities by targeting munitions depots, missile launching systems and air defense radar systems. ""We know precisely the capability that the Houthis have been employing against the Red Sea and the Bab al Mandab,"" Sims II said. ""This was solely designed to get after the capability that is impeding international freedom of navigation in international waters. We feel pretty confident we did good work on that,"" he added. But two unnamed US officials told The Times on Saturday that the operation had only destroyed or damaged about 20-30% of the group's offensive capabilities. Most of its weapons systems can be moved and hidden quickly as they are on mobile platforms, per the report. The officials also warned that the Houthis were likely to hit back, but one said the group appeared to be split on how to act. ""My guess is that the Houthis are trying to figure things out on the ground and trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them,"" Sims II said. ""I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation."" The US and the UK, supported by the Netherlands, Canada, Bahrain, and Australia, fired more than 150 munitions at areas controlled by the Iran-backed group in response to its continued assaults on ships traversing the Red Sea. A joint statement on the strikes released by 10 countries on Friday said that the move came as the Houthis persisted in targeting Red Sea shipping despite strong warnings calling for it to stop, with ""numerous missiles and one-way attack aerial vehicles"" launched at vessels on January 9 — including at US and UK ships. ""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea,"" the statement added. ""But let our message be clear: we will not hesitate to defend lives and ensure the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats."" The Houthi attacks began in response to Israel's major offensive against Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attacks. Nicholas Brumfield, a Middle East politics researcher who focuses on Yemen and maritime security, wrote in a report for the Foreign Policy Research Institute that the ""attacks are unlikely to cease, and may in fact escalate further, so long as Israel's campaign continues."" It has caused major concern over disruption to shipping in the region as some big shipping companies suspended operations as the attacks escalated. Insurance costs for vessels traveling through the Red Sea have also soared, with the most expensive ships potentially having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more per journey, David Osler, an insurance editor for Lloyd's List Intelligence, previously told The Associated Press.

Kari Lake, the pugnacious acolyte of former President Donald Trump who still hasn't conceded her 2022 loss in the Arizona governor's race, is making plenty of money off her enduring star power on the right. According to financial disclosure documents that Lake filed as part of her US Senate bid on Tuesday, the former TV anchor made at least $175,000 from paid speeches and book royalties. That includes $100,000 from Winning Team Publishing, the Trump-aligned outfit that published Lake's book, ""Unafraid,"" in 2023. The other $75,000 came from speeches Lake gave to conservative groups in Texas, California, New York, and Idaho, sometimes netting $15,000 for one appearance. Altogether, that's more than the $174,000 salary that she would make as a senator. Lake was required by federal law to file the disclosures. She's all but certain to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in the general election, and may face incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema as well. In a statement, a Lake spokesperson accused the media of having ""Kari Lake derangement syndrome."" The disclosures also reveal $101,507 in wages from Superfeed Technologies, a company once owned by former Arizona GOP chairman Jeff DeWit. Lake notably accused DeWit last week of trying to bribe her into staying out of politics, leading him to resign his position after she purportedly threatened to release even more damaging audio. In his resignation statement, DeWit did note that Lake was on his payroll at the time of their conversation — though he denied the bribery allegations. ""Instead of focusing on a public official unethically attempting to bribe Kari from seeking federal office, the media is fixated on her financial disclosure, which is not news,"" the Lake spokesperson said. ""She reported the same thing when she ran for Governor two years ago and acted ethically. DeWit was never her boss, as he never owned the company."" Lake did file a financial disclosure when she ran for governor, disclosing her position as a communications advisor for DeWit's firm. However, those documents did not reveal Lake's compensation amounts and included just two paid appearances. Lake certainly isn't alone in cashing in on being a political celebrity. Lawmakers on both the left and the right have, in some cases, managed to make more than their salaries via book sales. In 2022, top earners from book sales including Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Elizabeth Warren, while Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton led the list for Republicans.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kennethwinans/2024/01/26/politics--portfolios/,"Voter’s Investment Performance as an Election Poll Since the beginning of our nation’s history, many politicians have been successful investors. In fact, many congressional and presidential campaigns have been financed by the wealth of the candidates, family members, and devout backers. Do the fickle winds of economics really influence elections in America? We are in the midst of another presidential election campaign, and the rhetoric is running hot on which candidate’s policies are best for the economy. Maybe, historical investment performance can offer some insight of who to believe. Presidents and Investments In my 2019 book, “Investment Atlas II – Using History as a Financial Tool”, I evaluated all U.S. presidential administrations since 1850 in terms of how stocks, bonds and housing did during their terms. You might not be surprised to know that Reagan’s two terms in the roaring 1980s showed a 138% increase in stocks, a 72% increase in home values and 162% increase in corporate bonds as inflation subsided and interest rates declined. Surprisingly, the best one term was that of the obscure Rutherford B. Hayes (1877) when investments increased an amazing 369% in just four years! Not all investment bull markets are generated on the capitalistic Republican side. The best return for a Democrat was Clinton’s post-Cold War tenure of 263%, the second best ever. Clearly, the well-followed scandals of the Reagan and Clinton administrations didn’t matter to investors. On the flip side, both parties have had economic catastrophes on their watch. The Republican Hoover and Democrat Pierce posted disastrous investment losses, but no president had the highs and lows of Franklin Roosevelt (who’s face is on today’s dime). His four administrations made the list for best & worst single terms. So, how have the 21st century presidents matched up to their predecessors? Answer: above average to poor! Presidential Investment Ranking (1900-present) As the above chart shows, the total investment performance of the thirty-one presidential administrations since 1900 has ranged from 259% to (118%). Since 2000, there have been three Republican and three Democratic administrations. Obama’s first term and Trump tenure are a virtual tie and ranked 13th & 14th. The worst was G.W. Bush’s second term with a ranking of 28th. As of 2023, the Biden Administration currently ranks 27th with stocks advancing 33%, corporate bonds (11%) and housing modestly advancing 17% during this post COVID inflationary period. A good guide but not a predictor! Investment scoring is good for evaluating a presidential administration’s economic policies but not perfect in predicting whether an incumbent president will be re-elected. For example, G.H.W. Bush was ranked 10th overall and lost re-election. In contrast, Franklin Roosevelt was able to win a 3rd term (1940) after a disastrous second term ranking 30th! Money Matters to Voters! I have been a money manager since the early 1990’s and can clearly say that all investors (regardless of their political views) want to see their stocks, bonds and real estate appreciate within a healthy economic environment and reasonable tax structure. Economics will be a key point during this election, and I do think investors big and small will carefully evaluate claims made by both parties in light of concerns in their own investments, pensions and entitlements now and in the future. ",politics,relevant,"The article discusses the historical correlation between presidential administrations and investment performance, suggesting that investors may use this information as a guide in evaluating economic policies of candidates. It highlights successful investment periods under presidents like Reagan and Clinton, as well as economic catastrophes under presidents like Hoover and Pierce. The article also evaluates the investment rankings of presidents since 1900, showing that recent administrations have ranged from above average to poor in terms of investment performance. It emphasizes that while investment scoring can evaluate economic policies, it may not always predict re-election outcomes. The article concludes by stating that voters are likely to consider economic factors in the upcoming election, as all investors want to see their investments grow in a healthy economic environment."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68137013,"An Australian news channel has come under fire after it doctored an image of a female state MP that enlarged her breasts and exposed her midriff. The photo of Georgie Purcell appeared in a Nine News bulletin after she criticised the Victorian government's rejection of a duck hunting ban. Ms Purcell posted the original and altered images to social media, noting how her outfit had been edited. Nine News apologised and claimed ""automation by Photoshop"" was to blame.

You may want to read Twitter’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’. Ms Purcell is the youngest woman in the state's parliament and has frequently called out the ""constant sexualisation and objectification"" that women in Australian politics face. Speaking to the BBC, the Animal Justice Party MP said seeing the image had capped off what had already been her worst day since being elected in 2022. ""It's certainly confronting seeing your body altered on your TV in your own home,"" she said. ""What has happened to me in the past 24 hours is just something that would never, ever happen to a male politician."" Other politicians and members of the public have also been outraged. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan - who herself was controversially  depicted naked in a newspaper cartoon last year, said: ""That's no way to represent any woman, let alone a woman who holds a position in public office."" Nine News Melbourne boss Hugh Nailon has ""unreservedly"" apologised to Ms Purcell for the ""graphic error"". ""As is common practice, the image was resized to fit our specs. During that process, the automation by Photoshop created an image that was not consistent with the original,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to a tool which uses AI to expand pictures. ""This did not meet the high editorial standards we have."" But in a statement, a spokesperson for Adobe - the firm which produces Photoshop - told the BBC: ""Any changes to this image would have required human intervention and approval."" Ms Purcell said while she accepts Nine's apology, she is sceptical of their explanation. But if it was an accident, she says, it raises concerns about the threat of AI to women in public life and why newsroom staff did not notice her outfit had been sexualised. ""This is not just some random person on the internet. This is a organisation with a lot of staff and a lot of resources that frankly should know better."" Ms Purcell, who has previously spoken about working as a stripper to support herself through law school, has long been a target for sexist abuse, and says the altered image has already reinvigorated it. ""[They are] criticising me, telling me to get back on the pole, like weaponising it against me,"" she said.

Nine News apologized, blaming ""automation by Photoshop"" for the error, but Adobe, the company behind Photoshop, stated that any changes to the image would have required human intervention.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/politics/trump-store-fans/index.html,"Walk into Trump Town USA in Boones Mill, Virginia, and you may marvel at the breadth of human creativity, as long as you’re not distracted by how the merchandise tackles some of the most controversial political issues in the most vulgar way possible. The most spectacular specimens are in the back right corner: pairs of silvery, veiny metal testicles hanging from a ring and wrapped in protective clear plastic. “That’s Trump’s balls,” the store’s owner, Whitey Taylor, explains. The smaller set costs $75, the larger, $125. They’re heavy. There are dozens of independent stores across the country selling items supporting former President Donald Trump’s reelection bid. They are another unique feature of Trump’s appeal and what their customers buy offers some insight into what they want politically – and that is not subtlety. Taylor’s outlet is a prime example. A couple of weeks before the Iowa caucuses, business was brisk with out-of-towners flocking to a decommissioned church in a tiny village that is now packed with Trump merch. It’s like the Cave of Wonders from the movie Aladdin, except with more references to butts, poop and pee. A bumper sticker shows a cartoon Trump urinating on “Putin.” A keychain can be squeezed to make a tiny Trump defecate. “Moonie Trump” figurines depict the former president mischievously showing his naked backside. “We sell a lot of those,” said Taylor, who has long sought to create controversies of his own. The gag gifts may raise a smile among the customers, but they also show their passion, pride and faith in Trump. Dale Copeland was buying some Trump hats and a Trump sign to put over the garage he’d just built, “so when you pull in the driveway you see it. And then I’m going to post it all over Facebook.” He said he was afraid of an economic crisis to rival the Great Recession of 2008 and counting on Trump to prevent it. Back then, he said, “I lost everything I had. I barely survived … This is leading up to the same thing again. So, it’s coming. The downfall is coming.” He thought Trump could right the ship. He said he did brick and concrete work for a living in North Carolina, and his own business had been busy the last few years. But the economy had been tougher for his adult children, who he said would struggle to afford a home and car and were “more poor than what they should be.” Talking to Taylor, the store owner, he seemed to like the idea that Trump might mete out some retribution. “One thing about it: if he gets back in there, somebody’s going to prison,” Copeland said. The economy is on a lot of customers’ minds, said Melinda Williams, who works behind the register at Trump Town USA. “They’re very scared, I think, because of the way things are going,” she said. “They feel like where we’re at right now is stagnant, like it’s not going anywhere. And it’s definitely not going in a positive direction.” Another shopper, Mary-Jean Palmer, spoke thoughtfully about her politics and why she felt the criminal indictments against Trump were “just totally evil.” “I’m a reasonable woman,” she said. “I often wonder, what encourages people to be a Democrat? Because I don’t see a lot of kindness. I don’t see a lot of help for our country. And I see a lot of talk, no action. That’s why I like Trump.” Over her shoulder was a a rack of stickers, some reading “F**k Biden.” But while Taylor offers many items denigrating President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their Democratic Party, they don’t sell well. “They like the slogan. They like to read it,” Taylor said of the anti-Biden merchandise. But, “they won’t wear it.” Taylor had offered merch with a picture of Hillary Clinton in prison, “And they would say, ‘I don’t want that b*tch’s picture on my back.’ It was terrible.” Taylor keeps a close eye on political news to be ready for the next trend. When a big political meme pops up it sells well in the moment but fades within weeks. Trump’s mugshot from his criminal case in Fulton County, Georgia – available on T-shirts, yard signs, flags, and, of course, mugs – was “really hot” for about two months, Taylor said, before sales began to cool off. Same thing happened with the “Let’s Go Brandon” merch that sprung up after a sports reporter misheard a “F**k Joe Biden” chant. Taylor gets items from wholesalers and mom-and-pop shops around the country, and not everyone is a winner. Canned “AOC Brand Cow Farts” – a reference to a paper from (and later disavowed by) Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez linking Big Agriculture to climate change – have not sold well.  “This old guy spent $25,000 in Greensboro having that label made and all. Then he passes away. His wife calls me – she says, ‘You want all these cow farts? … Please come and get them out of my garage,’” Taylor explained. “I said, ‘OK, I’ll come get ‘em.” They sat stacked on a shelf next to the Moonie Trumps. There were prints of a painting showing Trump addressing reporters who were dressed like clowns, dart boards with Biden’s face, floral aprons with “Trump 2024” embroidered on them, Trump baby onesies, Trump clocks, a “Trump Train” flag, an “America First” flag and a flag that blended the American and Israeli flag. And then there’s a flag of the American Stars and Stripes being pulled upward by a muscular arm to reveal a Confederate flag behind it. What’s the next bestseller? “Who knows?” Taylor said. “Just have to wait. And the more the Democrats talk about MAGA crazy people, then, you know, something will spin off of it.” Taylor is well-known locally for stirring up controversy and getting his name in the newspapers. He owned a racetrack for decades, and said he knew how to pull stunts – like wet t-shirt contests or announcing a cockfighting match he never intended to hold – to make people mad and get attention. He’s long sold merch at big events, like special sunglasses for viewing the solar eclipse. (He made more money, he said, in the parts of the country where the sun was only 90% eclipsed than in the path of totality, where there was more competition.) Early in the 2016 race, before Trump had taken over the Republican Party, Taylor was selling racing merch at the Daytona 500, and prayed to God for guidance. “My son said, ‘Dad, what’s God telling us?’ It came in my spirit: ‘He wants me to help Trump,’” Taylor said. His son started laughing, “and profusely.” Taylor said he’d order 1,000 T-shirts. His son begged him to start with just 100. “I said, ‘Go big or go home, boy.’ I said, ‘If God’s telling me, we’ll sell every one of ‘em, and if not, we’ll throw ‘em in the trash can and leave.” His first item was a white T-shirt, and on the back, it read, “Donald Trump: Finally someone with balls.” Taylor said, “I became known as ‘the Balls Man’ on the tour.” If he skipped a campaign rally, other merchants would tell him college kids had come looking for him, asking, “Where’s the Balls Man?” In September 2020, he opened his store inside a hundred-year-old church by a stoplight on Highway 220. “Religious people come in here and they say, ‘Is this God’s house?’ I say, ‘No! it’s the house that Trump paid for.’” After the election, his big seller was “Stop the Steal.” Taylor believes the 2020 election was stolen (it wasn’t). But he thought the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was “a bad thing,” that the rioters “never should have gone inside.” Still, he said he did not blame Trump for the insurrection, and did not think Trump had a responsibility to convince the rioters to calm down. While making money is his business, Taylor also said he probably would not be interested in running a Trump store if the former president himself wasn’t so controversial. As for whether Trump himself – like some of the merchandise – was too crass, too vulgar and not presidential, Taylor responded: “The whole world has changed.” “It’s not really good that he does that … when he hollers ‘bullsh*t this’ and ‘bullsh*t that,’” Taylor said. “But, it is bullsh*t.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/argentina-lawmakers-debate-mileis-omnibus-economic-reform-bill,"Opposition has pledged to block the president’s mega-bill to reform the economy, politics and even some aspects of private life. Argentina’s lower house of Congress has begun what is expected to be a marathon debate on libertarian President Javier Milei’s mega-bill to reform the economy, politics and even some aspects of private life. The government raced to secure votes for the key “omnibus” reform bill on Wednesday, even as the left-leaning opposition pledged to block it. The bill initially contained 664 articles, but has lost almost half of these in tough negotiations with the opposition, which largely outnumbers Milei’s Libertad Avanza party that has just 38 of the 257 seats in the lower house of Congress. The bill is one the main planks in Milei’s reform push to tackle the South American country’s worst economic crisis in decades, with inflation over 200 percent and state coffers running dry. It marks the president’s first major test since the self-described “anarchocapitalist” took office in December after a shock election win in which he campaigned with a chainsaw pledging to slash spending and the size of the state. Milei, 53, faces a challenge to win over allies and push the bill through. His government yanked a divisive fiscal section from the bill last week to boost support. “Today, politicians have the chance to start reversing the damage they’ve caused the Argentine people,” Milei’s office said, urging lawmakers to support the bill.    In a sign of the challenge ahead, the main Peronist opposition bloc Union por la Patria, which is the largest single grouping in the National Congress of Argentina, said it would reject the bill, posting a picture with a slogan: “No to the Omnibus bill” on X. “We reject the Omnibus bill because it puts fuel in Milei’s chainsaw to hurt the daily lives of Argentines,” wrote Peronist politician and former Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero, a reference to his austerity plans to undo a deep fiscal deficit. Milei began his term in office by devaluing the peso by more than 50 percent, cutting state subsidies for fuel and transport, reducing the number of ministries by half, and scrapping hundreds of rules so as to deregulate the economy. His massive reform package touches on all areas of public and private life, from privatisations to cultural issues, the penal code, and divorce, to the status of football clubs. On Wednesday, outside the legislature, hundreds of protesters gathered to express their unhappiness with the reform bill, the AFP news agency reported. Moderate opposition lawmakers have warned they will seek further changes to the bill, in particular on the touchy issue of the delegation of special powers to the executive in an economic emergency, and on the scope and extent of privatisations. If the law is approved in the lower chamber – a debate that will likely extend beyond Wednesday – it would move next week to the Senate.

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/1/21/for-the-indian-muslim-ayodhya-is-everywhere,"Indian secularism is buried under a mountain of saffron politics, as Hindu nationalists celebrate the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Flipping through the radio channels on my drive to a meeting, I notice four out of the nine pre-sets blare triumphant tunes celebrating the upcoming inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. As I turn onto the road that connects Delhi and Gurgaon, I am confronted by an overwhelming burst of saffron. Illegal squatters who have long since taken over the pavements across this stretch of road have now been roped into peddling saffron flags. Larger-than-life posters depicting a muscular Ram wielding a bow and arrow dominate the streets. Street hawkers eagerly offer smaller versions of the flag adorned with Ram’s visage. Swords, paintings of deities and cut-outs of Ram punctuate every street corner. I greet the housing society guard with a nod, he responds with a delighted “Jai Shri Ram” (Glory to Lord Rama). The mood is that of a religious carnival rather than an ordinary day of business in the city. I learn from an enthusiastic WhatsApp message from an eager uncle in our housing society group that cinema chain INOX and Aaj Tak TV channel have tied up to livestream the triumphant inauguration of the Ram Mandir in 160 cinemas and more than 70 cities in India. Complimentary popcorn will be offered. My news app informs me that the Chairman of the Bar Council of India has requested the Chief Justice of India to declare a holiday in the Supreme Court and High Courts as a gesture “acknowledging the cultural and national significance of the event”. Further, I read a bizarre news item about flight attendants on an Indigo flight dressed up as Ram, Lakshman, Sita and Hanuman, greeting passengers at the gate. Apparently, a Lord Ram read out the boarding announcement. One has to wonder what truly devout Hindus feel about their beloved gods being reduced to a collection of cheap costumes at an airport or bout such blatant politicisation of religion that has little to do with true devotion. As an Indian Muslim who grew up in the 1990s, this is all simply bizarre to me. In my view, the significance of a temple – or indeed, a mosque – lies in matters of personal faith and worship and should not be transformed into a political symbol of national pride in a secular country. The purported “cultural significance” of the Ram Temple appears to be immersed in the murky waters of the polarisation we are currently navigating. Secularism, once a proud virtue every politician embraced, tucking it safely into his political repertoire, appears to be buried so far below the mountains of saffron-tinged communalism, that I fear it may never be recovered. Never before has my generation seen such a complete capitulation of the state to religion, nor the complete invisibilisation of the Indian Muslim – evident in the fact that for the first time in independent India’s history, India today has no Muslim Chief Ministers, Cabinet Ministers or MPs in the ruling party. In a simpler time, the very act of a sitting prime minister inaugurating a temple in secular India would have been considered improper and inappropriate. What is also missing is an acknowledgement of the bloody past that has led to this moment. For India’s Muslims, these celebrations are a painful demonstration of majoritarianism and polarisation. The demolition of the Babri Mosque is still a collective memory of grief and loss. Many of us remember those killed in the riots that followed the destruction. Despite political promises, the mosque was never restored, and now, a grand temple is to be built over its ruins – a monument to Hindu supremacy. Browsing Twitter in the morning, I read a tweet by a Muslim influencer, appealing to Muslims in India to practice restraint. To lie low, stay home and not become provoked by the insulting messages and visuals they are sure to encounter. Predictably, the tweet was followed by an onslaught of precisely the kind of offensive messages they had cautioned against. Among those living abroad, some have opted to cancel their annual visits to India, gripped by the fear of potential violence. Others, living in Ayodhya speak of removing their loved ones from the town for some time. Weddings have been postponed or scaled down. Mosques lay eerily quiet on Friday as local Muslims chose to pray in their homes. Yet, media channels are falling over themselves to report that a majority of Muslims are “happy” and “emotional” at the construction of the temple. As Indian journalist Betwa Sharma put it: “If you celebrate while someone else is in pain, something is broken in our society.” And yet, peace is the most precious commodity, clung to desperately. When something is too painful to endure, one simply awaits its passing, hoping for some form of closure. The Indian Muslim has become used to this. The winter has been a long and intimidating one.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68126892,"Liverpool singer Jamie Webster is a superstar in his home city, with a 40,000-capacity headline show coming up this summer. But his outspoken political and footballing allegiances have proved divisive elsewhere. When Webster played the biggest gigs of his career so far - two sold-out shows for 24,000 people on Liverpool's waterfront last summer - one intrepid fan spotted an opportunity to sneak in. The open-air concerts took place between two of the city's historic docks. ""There was a canal running right down the middle,"" the singer explains. ""Someone actually swam in. He didn't have a ticket, and he swam. It came through on the radio as I was in the security office. ""I said to the security, 'Look, whoever it is, please make sure you don't kick them out.' ""But the poor sod spent all his time in the medical tent."" People will apparently go to great lengths to see Webster, who has become a Scouse hero in the past few years. The former electrician made his name when 50,000 Liverpool FC fans joined him in singing his hymn to the Reds, Allez Allez Allez, before the 2019 Champions League final. Branching out from football and from his home city, Webster's anthemic and impassioned indie folk took his debut album We Get By to number six in the UK chart in 2020, and the follow-up Moments reached number three in 2022. He is hoping his third album 10 For The People, out on Friday, will give him his first number one. The 29-year-old fits catchy choruses into socially-conscious, politically-charged and observational songs about ordinary people, placing him somewhere between the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner and Billy Bragg. ""This is why the album's called 10 For The People,"" Webster says. ""It's an ode to my fans. It's an ode to the real people of the world because I haven't got here through industry backing, I haven't got here through radio playlists, I haven't got here through a major label. I haven't got here through any of that. ""It's all been done organically from grassroots, with a backdoor from a football terrace, which is unheard of. But you've got to ride your luck when you get it."" One song, Lovers in the Supermarket, was inspired by a photo his fiancee sent him of an elderly couple both holding a basket in Tesco. ""We've got a shared love of old couples,"" Webster says. ""You know when you see a really old couple walking down the street? It's beautiful, isn't it? Especially when they're of a certain age."" Webster is clearly too much of a romantic to contemplate that the basket just might have been too heavy for one of the couple to hold on their own. Upon seeing the picture, he ""almost melted"" and immediately bashed out the song. ""There are parts in the vocal where my voice goes really thin. That's because I'm welling up. For me, that's what music is - it's imagery, it's escapism, and you can realise how beautiful life is just from listening to a bit of music. ""That's what my music is. I've always said that since the first album. I document the joys, the trials and tribulations and the escapes of working-class life."" In a review of one of his concerts last summer, the Liverpool Echo said Webster ""commanded the adoring crowd who hung by his every word"". ""Music, politics and life are intrinsically linked for Jamie,"" the newspaper said, ""going seamlessly from the fast-paced Going Out to a powerful monologue before Davey Kane about his thoughts on the justice system. ""But despite these themes of poverty, mental health and a broken political system, the gig radiated joy and defiance."" Politics runs through almost everything in Webster's music. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's tub-thumping agitpop. In the song Something To Eat, Webster manages to sing a catchy chorus about the ""Brexit scam"", while the video for his ostensibly anti-war song How Do You Sleep At Night? features snippets of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Margaret Thatcher (plus Tony Blair for a bit of balance). His recent single Voice of the Voiceless was praised in the House of Commons by John McDonnell, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's former shadow chancellor. ""In an ideal world, I'd just be writing about all the beautiful things in life,"" Webster says. ""There are some of them, and I do try. But sometimes you just get bogged down with what's going on around you. ""People say to me sometimes, 'Just stick to the music, leave the politics to the politicians'. And my answer to that is, well they're not doing the best job of it as far as I can see. And the second answer is, life is political. Whether you know it or not, politics are affecting how your life is lived."" Being stridently anti-government and anti-establishment, he preaches to the choir in Liverpool, and has gained big followings elsewhere. ""What I'm saying is, just a bit of compassion for the fellow human being would be a start. That's all I'm trying to say in my music."" However, if you don't love Webster, his outspoken stance may well be alienating or even offensive. There is the matter of the anti-Conservative chants that go up, and that he leads, at his live shows. ""Obviously, there's a chant that is synonymous with me and my gigs, 'Eff the Tories',"" he says. ""But I'd just like to say, that didn't come from me. That's been a stronghold in the north of England at gigs and at football matches, for a long time, right? ""And I just amplified it because I agree with it, you know, and that's just me and my personal political opinion, which I'm entitled to."" When a Labour MP endorsed the chant on social media after seeing him at a festival in Warrington, it led the chairman of the local Conservative Party to describe it as ""hate speech"". ""I do get criticism because of how maybe tribal I am, because of how blunt I am, because of how edgy I am. I do speak from the heart. And I find it hard to put a filter on things at times,"" Webster says. ""If you like me, great, I like you. If you don't like me, it's not really my problem, you know what I mean? I know I'm trying to do a good thing and I know I make people happy with my music. ""I do realise, and I've been told by management, my mum and my fiancee, that this 'Eff the Tories' thing is going to become a problem,"" he admits. ""But to me, rule number one of showbusiness is give the people what they want."" The political and footballing connections will clearly prove a barrier to Ed Sheeran-esque stardom, but they have fed into his status in Liverpool. Webster became only the second local artist to headline the city's arena, after Sir Paul McCartney. That show, in 2022, was a sell-out and he had to cut his set short because of crowd congestion. He is now planning his biggest show yet, in the 40,000-capacity Sefton Park in July. Last year's two outdoor shows set a high bar, even if they were both different experiences - the first was a beautiful summer's night, the second a torrential storm. ""The stage was soaking wet, I was soaking wet."" The bloke who swam in, obviously, was also soaking wet. ""The crowd, God bless them, absolutely drenched,"" Webster continues. ""And what a night we had. It was just a party, a proper Scouse party. ""We could have had a tidal wave coming in off the Mersey and we would have still been trying to fight our way through it. It was defiance and euphoria and adrenaline just balled up into this big massive gig. ""I felt like the city was mine. No, in fact I felt like the city was ours, you know what I mean? More so, I felt like the world was ours at that point."" The world remains unconquered, but his home town has been.
